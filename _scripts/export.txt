There's plenty left to do around here. I'm in the process of moving from old WindBlows servers on ISDN to some almost-fresh *nix boxen on a nice speedy new ADSL connection, so beer, um bear with me on this one.

<p>
I've still got to get this stuff validated and cram some more friendly non-fixed font size CSS style sheets into this layout. :-)

<h4>Update</h4>
<p>I noticed the link at the top above the cows is broke. Sorry bout that resonance..get that fixed shortly.

Also, for any comment posters (not), the spam_protect option of MT is getting eaten by my server side xml transformations. In english: they are no spam protected until I get the templates changed.

A Russian hacker lured to the United States by the FBI under the ruse of a job interview is sentenced to three years in prison for computer crime ... The computers they used had software on them that logged every keystroke and FBI agents were able to <strong>later grab the men's passwords and download evidence off their computer network in Russia ... The FBI countered, and the judge agreed, that Russian law does not apply to the agents' actions. </strong>.

So let me get this shit straight,  someone from Russia can break an American law while in Russia, and we can nab him, but Americans can break Russian laws while in America and we're somehow not guilty of anything?

<p>
Here's the sad part: seeing this headline in a real newspaper would not surprise me one little bit.

If there were such a thing as 'geek' porn, <a href="http://www.powernotebooks.com/5620_Pics.php3" title="Sager 5660 details page">this page</a> and <a href="http://www.powernotebooks.com/5660specs.php3" title="Sager 5560 details page">this page</a> surely would be part of it IMHO. Look at all those geeky specs and definitions! :-)
</p>
<p>
About 2 months ago, my Compaq Presario 18XL380 kicked the bucket. Apparently, the power jack felt the need to liberate itself from the motherboard. At the time, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise: Until Today.
</p>
<p class="image">
	<img src="/blog/images/hardware/np5660.jpg" width="247" height="227" alt="Sager NP5660 Picture" /><br />2.8GHz P4, 1GB Ram, ATI Mobility Radeon 9000. Wow.
</p>

<h4>Update</h4>
<p>
One NP5660 on it's way!. Ships Monday, should arrive on Wednesday. Review forthcoming after arrival.
</p>

EXTENDED BODY:
<p>
Like all true geeks, I have more than one computer; 9 to be precise. Yes, <b>nine</b> computers about the office, 10 if you count the laptop the woman has which techically is mine. :-)
</p>

<ul>
<li>three(3) 1U FreeBSD servers</li>
<li>one(1) 4U FreeBSD server</li>
<li>one(1) HP Pavillion771n running XP (for games ok!)</li>
<li>one(1) built-like-a-tank Gateway NT4 server</li>
<li>one(1) HP Vectra Xm FreeBSD mail hub</li>
<li>one(1) Apple Power MAcintosh G3 (Beige)</li>
<li>one(1) Compaq Presario 18XL380 (Deceased)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Still not convinced?
</p>

<p class="image">
	<img src="/blog/images/hardware/server_rack.jpg" width="321" height="612" alt="Server Rack Photo" />
</p>
<p>
Now here is where the reasoning starts to fall apart after a truely sad chain of geek events.
</p>
<p>
First I bought the 1U rack servers in the hopes of converting away from the Gateway NT4 server towards Unix. The more I see MicroShaft in action, the less pleased I am about seeing a WinHozed box in my presence.
</p>
<p>
Then I converted my old desktop (Dual P3 450) into a 4U file server. Gotta have a place for <del>the porn and MP3 files right?...umm...I mean</del> the server backups and important files. :-) 
</p>
<p>
After that started, I spent a lot of time in the living room in front of the television with the notebook on my lap. Surfin. Hackin. Codin. Surfin. Flipping channels.  Watchin Alton Brown. You know the routine. Unfortunately, that also means I was getting no real work done.
</p>
<p>
Then the laptop croaked. The warranty had expired a year ago, and the only recourse was to pay Compaq for a new motherboard. NOT. So back to the Pavilion in the office I go. By now I'm finally getting work done. Converting to Unix. Surfin.  Codin. Playin <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/outcast/" title="JKII home page">Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</a>. But I digress.
</p>
<p>
But then today I ran across the specs for the new <a href="http://www.powernotebooks.com/5660specs.php3">Sager NP5660</a> and about dropped a load in me shorties. For the a lot less than what IBM, Dell, or Alien Ware wanted for the same (usually slower) specs, I'm getting one bitching machine that blows most desktops out of the water.
</p>
<p>
I'll do a full write up and review when she get's here, which should be around Monday of next week.

AHH, I have the 5660 Sager with the Radeon 9000. I would love to get BSD loaded on this critter (even gentoo would be a nice thing) but have not been very lucky (or brave enough to unload, backup and do a full install and lose a week of productivity in the process). If you get bsd or linux loaded and everything works, I would love to know what some problems were with everything or if it was a easy deal (never in my lifetime). 

Thanks

Don't let the Compaq 18XL380 die yet!!  Try this site for a repair.  I have no association with them but my 18XL390 did the same thing.  Sounds like a Compaq issue.

Another round of changes for this site.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added page title below the site menu</li>
<li>Decreased the size the the entry titles</li>
<li>Finally got that stupid posted date closer to the entry title</li>
<li>Monthly archive links on the left of most blog pages</li>

<li>Font-size friendly style sheets</li>
<li>Printer friendly style sheets</li>
<li>Get a clue</li>

Let me know what you think!? It's been a looong time since I've even had a homepage!
</p>
<p>
<strong>P.S.</strong> I still say there is something strange with pings to moveabletype.org. Sometimes the screen says it's pinging even though I'm just making a spelling correction; no new entry; no Post Status change. Curious.

From <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,55675,00.html" title="Article about Wired News redesign"><cite>Wired News</cite></a> :

Wired News has a different appearance, but the new design isn't just about look and feel. The site now complies with standards recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium for greater access to all users.

I've got mixed feelings about this one. I'm a programmer by trade, so I tend to see things like this in black and white. <acronym title="You can't lie to a compiler">It either compiles or it doesn't</acronym>. So on the one hand, when they say they've used W3C standards like XHTML and and CSS instead of crappy HTML3.2 and Tables, I say Bravo!
</p>
<p>
However, my first instinct was to run the page through the W3C validator, and to my dismay, it <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://www.wired.com/" title="Validate wirednews.com">does not validate</a>. So, the programmer in me say they are NOT using standards because it doesn't validate as such.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/1002a.html#wired" title="Zeldman's comments on redesign">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> brings up a few good points for people like me with that first reaction. He says
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Hardcore standards geeks sometimes judge the intentions of a site's owners and creators based on one critieria only: does it validate? When a site fails to validate, some geeks infer that the people behind the site made no effort. As the Wired redesign makes clear, validation alone does not tell the full story. ... In short, do not confuse fundamentalism with evangelism, or necessarily equate lack of compliance with lack of care."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm not quite sure I buy into the "3rd Part Software/Advertising Code" issue though. Now a days, we have these high tech things called <a href="http://sitescooper.org/tao_regexps.html" title="Link to regular expression how to">regular expressions</a> and find/replace to fix problems like that. :-)
</p>
<p>
He's right. Sometimes it's the measure of the effort, not the result that counts. Congrats to Wired News!

My brain hurts. TrackBack is now enabled. My only complaint so far is that I can't [easily] modify the URL that get's sent in the TrackBack ping. What would you need to? Well, for starters, the <code>$MTCGIPath$</code> doesn't work to well for this site. I do all of my blogging under an SSL Client Certificate secured URL, but you are viewing this blog at a different URL. With a little work, that's not so bad.
</p>
<p>
One of my goals with this site was to start eating my own dog food so to speak. Make sure the pages validate. Make sure I'm seperating style from content.  Make sure font sizes are resizable instead of fixed pixil heights (still have to do that yet). And make sure that the URLS are human readable and don't change if I decide to switch server languages/platforms. <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> has a good article called <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/succeed/">How to Succed With URLs</a> that I think every CMS vendor needs to read. :-)

For example, let's say I have an individual entry archive page you want to link to. The URL could be
</p>

<pre>
<code>
http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/archives/entries/000001/
</code>
</pre>

while the <em>real</em> page may be located at

<pre>
<code>
http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/archives/entries/000001.xsp
</code>
</pre>

<p>
So what happens if next year I want to move from using eXtensible Server Pages on Apache to using PHP on [shudder] Windows IIS?
Now the URL for the actual page above would change from
</p>

<pre>
<code>
http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/archives/entries/000001.xsp
</code>
</pre>

to

<pre>
<code>
http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/archives/entries/000001.php
</code>
</pre>

but the the URL used on my website and others links to that entry would still be

<pre>
<code>
http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/archives/entries/000001/
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Without the URL mapping, we would have a lot of broken links everywhere.
</p>
<p>
So what was my point again? Ah yes, TrackBacks.
</p>
<p>
TrackBack pings send the URL of the <em>real</em> page (i.e. <code>/000001.xsp</code>) instead of what we would really like people to use ( <code>/000001/</code> ). Ouch!
</p>
<p>
Time to start writing up a patch I guess. :-)

Believe it or not, I started out (after 14 years) in music. I graduated college with a BA in Music Education K-12, and a BA in Music Performance. I haven't taught a day since graduation. :-/ I immediately went into programming and never looked back. I guess I like programming because it was just like music believe it or not; all about creating something from nothing and solving problems along the way.
</p>
<p>
I find myself going in large cycles of interest. First is was music, then *cough* Windows programming, then on to Unix sysadminning and Perl programming. I imagine it's only a matter of time before I get bored enough to take up basket weaving or something. :-) Maybe it's just us Ohio boyz.

My apologies to anyone (all -2,538 of you) actually coming to this site over the next couple of days. I'm in the process of migrating from my old ISDN line over to the new ADSL connection. I'm a little hesitant to leave these new servers on until I can give them the upgrade to 4.7-STABLE and double check all the security related stuff. In other words, I shut them off at night!

The older I get, the more things I put on my mental list of things I never will, or should own. Why?  Well, just because. I'm a a computer programmer and a sysadmin. Before that I was a musician, and before that a teenager.  I know computers. I'm not a genius or an expert, but I'd like to think I know a little more than most about my areas of practice. When you talk geek to me about computers, I follow it quite well. If you try to talk to me about rebuilding and engine, I'm clueless. Kind of ironic considering <a href="http://www.summitracing.com/" title="Visit summitracing.com">where I work</a>.  :-)
</p>
<p>
They say part of being successful is to know your limits, admit them, and ask for help when necessary. I can't fix things (well), so I know when not to try. Always hire a professional. So with that in mind, here are the things I will never own, if for no other reason that for my safety:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Guns</strong><p>I would shoot myself in the foot somehow. I like my toes to much.</p></li>
<li><strong>Chainsaw</strong><p>See Above. I like my legs to much.</p></li>
<li><strong>Circular Saw/Table Saw</strong><p>See above. I like my fingers to much.</p></li>
<li><strong>Wood Chipper</strong><p>Yup. See above.</p></li>
<li><strong>Pnuematic Nailer</strong><p>Once you've see an xray on TV of a skull with a nail it. Nuff said.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The funny part about most of those *saw things: I did 4 years of shop class in high school without incident. Go figure.

I bet someone at MicroShaft is just fuming over this one, again.  If you'll recall, A while back, a lot of people over at the <a href="http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/"><cite>XBox Linux Project</cite></a> were putting effort on turning the XBox into a commodity desktop/server appliance. Once someone figure out the encryption junk used, they finally make linux run on an XBox. There's even a <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-942139.html">Mandrake 9 release for XBox</a>!
</p>
<p>
So what does MicroShaft do? Use their financial clout to <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-961498.html" title="Article about the shutdown of the mod chips">shut down the foreign makers of the XBox mod chip</a> that makes this possible. On top of that, they released a <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-959084.html" title="Article about the updated XBOX">new modified version of the XBox</a> that was more secure and 'unmodable'.
</p>
<p>
Well,  it <a href="http://www.xboxhacker.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=3da7ede1778bffff;act=ST;f=7;t=7264" title="Post about XBOX being cracked">looks like MicroShaft/XBox are someone's bitch</a> once again. :-)

From the shut-your-cake-hole-and-make-one department.
</p>

Since AxKit seemed to not have a badge in the style I like (see bottom left of all pages), I fired up ye olde Power Mac G3 w/ Photoshop and made one. First time that machine has been on in the last 7 months I believe.

Gogle is an amazing thing. This site is not yet 'live', aka I still shut the servers off at night until I feel they are ready for prime time.
So that fact that Google found the time to spider my site, and that I show close to the top for something is really cool.

Well, I finally took the plunge and tweaked the stylesheet  to use relative font sizes with the help of 
<a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_26_using_relative_font_sizes.html" title="Article on using relative font sizes">this article</a> over at 
<a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" title="Visit diveintoaccessibility.org">Dive Into Accessability</a>.
</p>
<p>
What I don't like so far:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The font size for most of the content uses small, which compared to the pixel sizes is somewhere between to small and to big.</li>
<li>The stylesheet used to pass the W3C validator with no errors and no warnings. here still are no errors, but a whole lot of warnings creeped in.</li>
<li>The layout gets crazy in Mozilla when I resize now. It never used to do that with pixel fonts sizes. Although, Mozilla would resize all fonts regarless of relative or fixed while IE wouldn't play nice.

</li>
</ul>

<p>
It all comes back to eating your own dog food again I guess. Something to change my mind about later go do with cookies/javascript selected stylesheets 
with the pixel sizes changed instead of being relative.
</p>
<p>
What do you think?
</p>
<h4>Update</h4>
<p>
Damn. The CSS validator does fine if I upload and specify the options, but it does't work in general from the Valid CSS links on this page. Time to ditch relative and go back to fixed. :-(

<p>
	My brain hurts. No really. Being a true paranoid about all things security related, I decided to
	lock down the email server for the outside people who will be sending mail through it. Why? Well. In order to prevent
	being an <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci782509,00.html" title="Definition fo an Open Relay">Open Relay</a>, we want to require passwords 
	from people who want to send out email from our email server. These people will also be logging in 
	using <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid26_gci212805,00.html" title="Definition of POP3">POP3</a>
 	or <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid26_gci214022,00.html" title="Definition of IMAP">IMAP</a> to fetch their email.
</p>
<p>
	So what's the problem? Well, everytime you log in to a POP3 or IMAP server to fetch your email, or log in to an SMTP server to 
	send mail (assuming that SMTP server requires a password to send mail), 
	you are sending your password in <strong>plain text</strong>, <strong>unencrypted</strong> for the whole world to see!  Not good.
</p>
<p>
	What's the solution? Why 
	<a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci343029,00.html" title="Definition of SSL/TLS">SSL/TLS</a> of course!
	And the nice part is, you don't have to fork cash over to Verisign just to get SSL certificates. 
	Become <a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#ToC29" title="How-To become your own ceritifcate authority">your own</a> <acronym title="Certificate Authority">CA</acronym>!
</p>
<p>
	Now, with the help of some HOW-TO docs on the net and a handy firewall or two, all external persons we wish to allow to send outgoing email 
	must use IMAP over SSL (IMAPS), POP3 over SSL (SPOP3), or TLS over SMTP in addition to their usual user names and passwords. Way cool, but not exactly easy.
</p>
<p>
	Here's a list of links that got me through it without killing someone or throwing a server out of the window:

Second thing, our product is a more complete product. <strong>We have a built-in application server that's well integrated - there is no such comparable notion in the Linux server.

<p>
What MicroShaft calls 'incomplete' I call choice. Here's a crazy thought. Maybe I <em>don't want</em> the application server 'in' the OS. Maybe I want to use a different application server.

Replied Freeh: "I have not given up on encryption." In his statement at the time, he said that "law enforcement remains in unanimous agreement that the continued widespread availability and increasing use of strong, non-recoverable encryption products will soon nullify our effective use of court-authorized electronic surveillance." ...
Soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, Gregg said he would introduce legislation to limit the availability of encryption without backdoors for government spying. After encountering widespread criticism, however, Gregg chose not to introduce the proposal.

Apparently the Valid <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>/<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> buttons and links on this site are broken.

Subject: WebUtils taglib

Is there a reason that the WebUtils taglib looks at the "VIA:"
header rather than $r->hostname first?  When the request is
coming from a proxy, it yields incorrect results.

This patch fixes the problem (this against 1.3_90 instead of 1.4):

     $hostname ||= $ENV{HTTP_HOST};

Mark.

Looks like it works here because I'm zapping/anonmizing proxy headers via the following line in squid.conf:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
anonymize_headers deny Referer Via X-Forwarded-For
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Well, that would explain it!

All fixed - in theory. At least no crashy crash on pagey load.
Looks like the patch fixes the problem.

To bad for the children their parents are dolts.

In defense of the aforementioned girlfriend, (and yes I am indeed happy to see my title appear in print.  Sorry Ladies, he is TAKEN!!) Parents do not realize that in the moment they are turned around picking out peas from the grocery store self, their kid can fall four feet to the cement floor onto their newly formed skulls.  The type of brain injuries I see keep the body organs intact and perfect for transplant.  SO, if you are going to be so foolish as to ignore the seatbelts in the carts, please remember there are children in hospitals who can benefit from the organs of your precious child!  How many times have you heard,,"but I just turned around for a second....."  I hear it all the time as I am zipping up the body bags.  Thanks for the kidneys!

After growing up (and STILL today) watching TNG all the time, it's strange to read the daily thoughts and such by someone who was a 'star' on one of the Star Trek series. Yes, I know they are just poeple yada yada, but still. In a way, it's cool to read his thoughts and get a feel for what kind of <strong>person</strong> he is instead just <cite>Wesley Crusher</cite>.

<h4><a id="background">Background</a></h4>
<p>
As I've <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000007/" title="Post about ordering the Sager 5660">mentioned before</a>, my Compaq Presario 18XL380 died about 2 months ago.
The power jack decided that it had enough, and broke away from the motherboard, leaving me with a pile of spare parts shaped like a laptop.
Since the warranty had expired in December 2001, there was no way I was going to pay Compaq $600+ for another motherboard.
So I set about the task of researching what was out there and what features I could live with for the right price.
</p>
<p>
Compaq was out of the question again. I didn't much like IBM prices, Dell had a bad taste in my mouth after supporting them in college, but I did
like the HP I bought the woman for school. IT had a durable case design and we've had no problems with it so far. However, after the HPaq-ComP merger,
I wasn't having any real confidence in the current status of either brands laptop.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I stumbled across the AlienWare <a href="http://www.alienware.com/main/system_pages/area51-m.asp" title="ALienware Area 51M product detail page">Area51m</a>, and started to drool at the options.
Some more usenet grepping, and I found out about Sager,
<a href="http://www.sagernotebooks.com/">sagernotebooks.com</a>, and eventually the <a href="http://www.powernotebooks.com/5660specs.php3" title="Sager NP5660 Specs">Sager NP5660</a>
at <a href="http://www.powernotebooks.com/">powernotebooks.com</a>. I was a little hesitant to order from PowerNotebooks because of their "Cash Discount" stuff on the website,
but after even more reviews and all the info at <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com/" title="Reseller Ratings Website">Reseller Ratings</a>, I felt the most comfortable ordering from PowerNotebooks.
I could have save a few bucks here and there with Discount Laptops, but better safe than sorry.
</p>



<h4><a id="specs">Specs</a></h4>
<p>
I ordered the Sager NP5660 Supra with the following options:
</p>

<ul>
<li>P4 2.8GHz CPU</li>
<li>40GB Ultra ATA/100 Hard Drive at 5,400 RPM</li>
<li>1024MB PC2100 DDR Memory</li>
<li>UXGA (1600 x 1200) TFT Active Matrix LCD Display w/ ATI Radeon Mobility 9000 w/ 64MB</li>
<li>Combo 8X DVD/16x10x24 CD-RW</li>
<li>Extra 24X CD ROM Module</li>
<li>3 Additional Years Extended Warranty</li>
<li>UPS 2nd Day Shipping</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Considering my last (still fixable) laptop croaked out of warranty, and the price of this new one, I would be insane to have not gotten the additional warranty.
</p>



<h4><a id="ordering">Ordering</a></h4>
<p>
Ordering was painless. I ordered on Wednesday, October 8th, 2002. I'm used to ordering things online, so fessing up that kind of bling over the net doesn't really phase me.
I opted to used my credit card instead of a money order because a) I'm lazy, and b) I wanted the security of a card purchase in case I
had to stop payment, of make and claims against the purchase w/ the credit card company. Just a little more leverage if needed over a money order.
</p>
<p>
Within a few hours, someone from PowerNotebooks called to make sure it was actually me placing the order. I love when companies do that. That way they ward of fraud
and I don't end up with a bill for 3 big ones with no idea who placed the order and where it went. By the end of the day, the payment stuff was completed and taken care of
and I had email receipts in hand. I fired off an email inquiring about the ship date of the computer. I was told that the laptop would ship on Monday, October 14th, 2002, and that
I should have it Wednesday, October 16th, 2002. Not bad. Not bad at all.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, I sent another email just to make sure it was shipping. Both me and the woman work and she goes to school full time, so there rarely anyone here to accept packages.
The were a chance that if I knew what day it would be here, I'd just scam a vacation day and play with the new toy. Donald returned my email promptly and told me that I was misinformed
and that the laptop would ship either Tuesday or Wednesday.
Apparently they were just a tad behind due to the dock workers strike on the west coast. No big deal really. These things happen. It actually turned out to be good as the 5400RPM hard drives were going to
become available Tuesday, so I upgraded to the faster drive and sprung the extra $15 for the Next Day Air Saver shipping. :-)
</p>
<p>
Let me just say that I'm really impressed with PowerNotebooks at this point. Try calling Dell or IBM and changing your order the day of or the day before it ships.
I bet it doesn't go so well, or as easily as it did with PowerNotebooks. Donald was  very helpfull and understanding, and kept me informed whenever possible.
</p>


<h4><a id="shipping">Shipping</a></h4>
<p>
On Tueday, I got an email from Donald letting me know that the laptop had shipping and that I would probably get it long before they got a tracking number for it.
Next Day Air Saver has guaranteed deliver by 3-4pm for commercial, and 'by the end of the day'  for residential. I had a meeting at work in the morning, but came home around 11:30am.
i figured that UPS wouldn't even get there until after noon. Sure enough, they were too efficient that day, and tried delivery at 9:15am. DOH! So I called UPS and scheduled to have it held at the local hub
for me to pickup. Unfortunately, the earliest I could pick up the laptop was going to be Thursday!!! Nooooo!!!!!!! :-) I went back to work. Damn. This has always been on of my complaints
about UPS. WHen I get packages via FedEx, I can pick the packages up the same night as the first delivery attempt.
</p>
<p>
When I got back to work, I decided to send nastygram to the customer service department of UPS about having to wait another day to pick up stuff at the local hub. I didn't really
expect a reply from them.
I've had very poor service and bad luck with UPS in the past. I've seen at least 3 servers with forklift holes in them upon delivery, and other packages
completely smashed and put in different packaging from what they left the manufacturers warehouse in. So of course, I've learn to expect the worst from UPS.Much to my surpruse, I received a reply from them in about an hour.
They apologized for the inconvenience and said that they've started a new On Hold Same Day Pickup service. Woohoo! Game on! I left my phone numbers with them, and they actually called me around
3:30pm telling me I could pick it up that night when the truck returned from it's round. Sweet! By 6:30pm, this little scream machine was in my awaiting paws.
</p>
<p>
Much to my surprise, the box was in mint condition. Expecting to receive a squished package, it was still in fact a square item! Bonus.
</p>

	<br /><span class="caption">Click for larger image</span>
</p>
<p>
I noticed a warning type label on the top about the condition of the package when shipped, and that damage were the responsibility of the carrier.
I wish more shipper would put this on the packages.

<p>
Once I cracked open the boxed, I found that they double boxed the shipment. ANother nice touch.

Woohoo! We passed the UPS test. Onward.

<h4><a id="case">Case Design / Construction</a></h4>
<p>
On of the things I liked about her HP NP5440 notebook was that it had a beefy case design with nice sturdy material.
My Compaq was made of jello by comparison. This NP5660 has a nice sturdy case. The lid has just enough resistance and the hinge assembly seems to be nice
and rugged. Despite its 9.5 pound rating, I don't really find this laptop terribly heavy at all.
</p>

<h4><a id="setup">Setup / Installation</a></h4>
<p>
I had purchased a full copy of Windows XP Pro for my last laptop. Since it is now dead, I ordered the new Sager sans OS. I popped in the install CD and rebooted.
I went into the BIOS  before installation just for giggles. This machine has a full BIOS by all appearances, unlike some of those other laptops where you can add/change a BIOS password and change the clock and that's all.
After I installed XP and rebooted, the video was bumped up to 1600x1200 32bit color, although the XP driver was sluggish at best.
I popped in the drivers CD and installed all the drivers without a hitch. The user manual covers the installation of all the drivers for each OS. The manual refers to 98SE, ME, 200o, and XP, so I'll assume all those
other OSs are supported on this laptop. <acronym title="Your Mileage May Vary">YMMV</acronym>. The only hitch I had was with the USB 2.0 driver. If you double clicked the Setup.exe file, it ran but did nothing. IF you tried updating the driver via the device manager,
the driver installed and we were off to the races. Another reboot. Installed XP Service Pack 1 (thank god for DSL and 1.5 down speads) and all the latest hotfixes and security patches. One last reboot. No errors. No problems. All devices found, loaded, and operating.
</p>



<h4><a id="video">Display / Video</a></h4>
<p>
Initially, I set the display to 1600x1200 32bit. Very nice, although it will take some getting used to. I turned on ClearType and bumped the resolution down to a non-native size.
I tried both 1024x768 and 1200x1024. Under both resolutions, you could tell the screen text and such was 'different', but I wouldn't label it blurry and bothersome. All in all, I'm very impressed and happy with
the choice of UXGA. I actually think it looks a little better than the Sony laptop I tinkered with the same LCD specs.
</p>
<p>
Since I will be playing Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, Unreal Tournament*, and Quake II on this thing, it was time to install 3DMark 2001. I installed 3dMark2001 Build 330. For the
tests, I left all driver settings and 3DMArk settings as is with the exception of changing the resolutions.
</p>

<ul>
<li>First run at 1024x768: 7100</li>
<li>Second run at 1600x1200: 3859</li>
<li>Third run at 1280x1024: 5148</li>
<li>Fourth run at 800x600: 8753</li>
</ul>

<p>
	All in all, this is a kick ass gaming machine for a laptop!
</p>



<h4><a id="performance">Performance</a></h4>
<p>
	Nothing to in depth here. A few SisSandra tests for the curious...
</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="/blog/images/np5660/sandra_cpu_memband.png">MEmory Bandwidth Benchmark</a></li>
</ul>


<h4><a id="battery">Battery Life</a></h4>
<p>
	My first run at testing the battery life wasn't any surprise. It took just over 1 hour and 30 minutes to go from 100% charge to 3% charge, at which time
	the lappy started beeping and went into standyby mode.
</p>


<h4><a id="heat">Heat / Noise</a></h4>
<p>
The only noticeable heat comes out of the vents on the far left side of the laptop.
Not much heat on the top or on the bottom of the machine. The noise isn't nearly as loud as it could be. Slightly louder than a
regular laptop, but certainly nothing close to the noise coming out of a desktop box.
</p>


<h4><a id="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h4>
<p>
Overall I think this was a great purchase compared to what else is out there. Only time will tell when it comes to the durability of the machine.
My only gripe is that the hard drive clicks slightly more than my other laptops have in the past, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.

When you got your laptop, does it have the "Sager" logo on it? Some photos on Powernotebooks.com do and some don't have the logo. In fact, I prefer mine to not have a logo.

I sell the power jack that fit Compaq Presario laptops.  Instead of paying $600.00 for a new motherboard you can buy this part for under $20.

When you have time to do some serious gaming, give us an update.  I'm buying this so my back will quit griping about lugging my PC around to LAN Parties.  I'll still take the rigs, but for the less demanding sessions, I'm taking my laptop.

Hi blog, 
I'm also considering buying a Sager, and I wonder, why did you choose the NP5660 over the NP8886?  Was it the weight or the screen resolution, or the price, or..?
Cheers,

I never really likes the 888x models. The keyboard was to far left for my taste and the keypad on the right side would drive me nuts. I wanted the 1600x1200 resolution, and the MP# player would've never gotten used. Plus the 5660 was the only one with the ATI M9000 at the time.

Hello, 

    Chris - I had written you about this laptop.  Just got mine.  Hit 7056 on 3DMark2001SE compared to around 5000 with my Inspiron 8200 2 GHz-M with a GeForce4 440 card. Happy with the purchase.  The *only* thing is the viewing angle.  The enhanced UXGA on the Dell is much wider, so if you're doing Photoshop work full-screen images look more evenly lit on the Dell.  *But* the Sager stays bright when you use battery power vs. AC.  The Dell tones down the screen on battery power to save juice.  

I've just installed all the software...time to play... :) 

PS - For anyone thinking of getting a larger hard drive: the Sager uses a 9.5mm 40GB Toshiba drive.  IBM's 5400RPM 60GB drive is 12.5mm, so it won't fit the Sager's 9.5mm hard drive chassis.  I believe you can get a Toshiba 60GB that will fit, but it will run at the slower 4200rpm.  In other words, if you want 5400rpm, the largest drive you can get for the Sager at the moment is 40GB. 

Just a bit of trivia for those wanting more space....

How's the keyboard feel on the Sager?  Dell Delicious or Molasses Mac?  Dare I hope for the keys light, yet springy, with that satisfying click to them?

The keyboard is nice; similar to the Dell in feel, but not laid out exactly the same.  It's very springy.  The only thing I [personally] don't like about it is that the CTRL key is smaller than what you would find on the Dell. The Sager has a Fn (Function key) in addition to the CTRL key, whereas the Dell has one wide CTRL key in the same amount of space. 

So...if you're working in Photoshop, for example, or doing much copying-and-pasting, you have to be more precise on the Sager with your typing (or pinky) when using CTRL-V or CTRL-C.  I sometimes find myself hitting the "Fn" key when I want to be hitting the CTRL key. 

Pretty minor, but I thought I'd note it. 

Otherwise, a very nice keyboard.

I have a few questions.  How much difference is there between the SXGA+ and the UXGA display.  What about adapters?  Did it come with a car/wall adapter?  How long did it take to charge the comp from 3% to 100% again?   

All information is appreciated.  

I'm planning on buying one for the wife on business trips. (strong enough for a man, but made for a woman... heh) 

GREAT REVIEW, by the way.  I really appreciate you doing this! =)

Hello, 

I don't know how much Chris checks in here, so I'll give an answer. 

The laptop comes with a standard AC adapter that can be plugged into a wall. PowerNotebooks.com sells an auto inverter, but I'm going to guess it's the same as what you can get at Radio Shack. The only issue I've had with auto inverters is that I once had one that caused noise/feedback when I used it with my Dell laptop, but I don't know if this happens with other models. 

I have never timed it, but it usually takes a few hours to charge two onboard batteries from 50% (which is how much I normally use).  Using the 2nd modular bay for a spare battery should give you around 3 hours or so of use. In my personal experience, trying to charge the battery while using the laptop will result in longer charge times.  For example: I use the laptop for about an hour each morning on battery, then I plug it in when I get to work.  It takes most of the workday to bring two batteries back from 50% to 100% if the laptop is on and being used, but less time if the laptop is off. 

SCREEN:
This is truly personal preference. I don't like anything less than UXGA...although SXGA+ is decent.  The problem with UXGA is that font size is reduced, but the positive tradeoff is that you have a sharper screen. To deal with the decrease of the font size with the resolution increase, you can set your preferences in Windows and Explorer for larger fonts/larger icons.  You can also get a program called LiquidView from Portrait Displays which helps you quickly adjust your settings: 

<a href="http://us.portrait.com/products/lv.htm" rel="nofollow">http://us.portrait.com/products/lv.htm</a>

You should also activate Cleartype: 

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/default.htm</a>

After doing those things, most text/resolution issues should be resolved.  Many application menus will still be small, but I [personally] have gotten used to it as a necessary evil to have the sharp screen.  

It's an ongoing conflict: 

higher resolution -> smaller type -> pixels less visible

lower resolution -> bigger type -> pixels more visible. 

I would strongly recommend previewing laptops at a local electronics store and comparing different native screen resolutions (XGA vs. SXGA vs. UXGA).

I do check eventually. :-P
I've been busy getting the new DSL connection and servers squared away, and am currently fighting the USB2 drivers on this beast to get an external enclosure to work correctly. I'm getting the impression that the USB2 drivers and VIA chipset are worthless for anything other than mice on this Sager 5660. And in true Murphy fashion, the only FireWire calbe I have is the 6pin-6pin, and not the 6pin to lappy cable since the connector on the back is diferent. Go figure.

Re: colors 

No, it just comes in the one color.  

Alienware comes in a variety of colors, but you spend $61 or more just for the new color. To be honest - I think they're kind of ugly, too...martian red and cyborg green look cool for about 10 minutes, but I think they'd get old pretty quick.  The Sager color scheme is kind of nice: a subdued metallic color. A soft blue/gray/silver color which will be nicer over time and not so trendy. *Although* I think the new Alienware irisescent "chameleon" color is kind of cool and a collector's item.

Hey Chris,
So is it out of date drivers?  Did you try to install the newest one's out?   I'm wondering because I am planning on installing a printer on it from time to time that is USB.

All help is appreciated!  Thanks~!

P.S. Good review!

To bo honest, I have no idea. Neither the supplied USB2 drivers on the CD-ROM that came with the lappy nor the ones downloaded from the Sager site would install...they would just sit there in the background after being double clicked.

What I ended up doing was expanding the xp*.cab file in the USB2 directory, and choosing Update Drivers within the decive manager for the VIA USBController.

The other part of my problem appreared to be the drivers that came with the USB/Firewire enclosure itself. Eventually I ended up deinstalling all USB stuffs under device manager, uninstalling the USB enclosure driver from Add/Remove programs, and letting XP refind everything. After that, everything was happy again.

I love technology. I never had any problems with USB mice or USB memory card readers. It was probably a driver vs. mass storage device drver issues.

Hi!

I still haven't gotten a conclusive answer to this question. On Dell's Inspirons your able to for the most part upgrade the vid card, (barring any BIOS incompatibilities), The card slides into a sort of mini-AGP form factor slot. Is it the same situation on the Sager/Alienware 54m? or is the chip soldered right onto the main board? I'm asking this because this is of the bigger, (amongst many), factors I'm considering between the two for my next laptop purchase.

Thanks!

You haven't gotten an answer and probably won't get an answer. 

First, Sager, Alienware and Dell all have the official line that video cards are not upgradeable.  A Dell technician *might* tell you that you can upgrade the video card yourself, but in doing so, you violate your warranty.  The only place I've found that even carries the video cards by themselves is on eBay, and my last attempt to purchase one fell-through after a month of the seller having $250 of my money. It isossible you could get one from a technician though...when I tried to get one directly from Dell, I spent 7 hours on the phone. 

Since opening up most laptop cases violates the warranty and there are few online technical guides for doing so, very few people will be willing to do it to answer your question. Sorry!  I've spent a lot of time looking for the same answer.

Hi. I want to purchase a new laptop and the Sager sounds almost too good to be true! The problem for me is that I've never heard about it. I talked with the dealer that you purchased your notebook from and he said that they don't send Sager's in for reviews to many mags. because to get a good review, you neet to spend a lot of advertising dollars. I felt this sounded like a B.S. reason for a company not to have their units independently tested (except by LAPTOP mag that I never heard of, and if willing to let Laptop review them, why not the others??) This makes me hesitent to purchase their laptop. It seems they don't want an impartial review in a major magazine out there for the public to see. I saw you review and really appreciate it, but do you have any comment or concerns that they don't have send their laptops in for more  independent reviews? Makes me feel like they are trying to hide something that will look bad in a review??
P.S. I am NOT a tech. person. When I spend this kind of money, I just want to know that it is a quality machine. You hear a lot about Dell, Gateway, etc. both positive and negative. I've just never heard much about Sager at all! Very few people seem to have even HEARD about their product, (let alone reviews). Can you help me with this? I don't know how to use these posts very well, so if you can forward me an email directly, much appreicated. uniaxi@aol.com
Thank you so much!!!

I'd never seen nor heard about the Sager laptops either, but I'll never go back to name brand. PErsonally, I don't believe any reviews done by mags; just ones by people who actually sepdn their own money on them, as well as Anandtech and Toms Hardware. Go to resellerratings.com and checkout the ratings for PowerNotebooks, Sager (the dealer, not the manufacturer/online retailer), Dell, Toshiba, etc.  Take note of the number of comments, their attitudes, good and bad, and the comapny ratings.

I am 100% confident I made the right purchase. It's the best lappy I've ever owned.

I have been hearing that the memory used with Sager's chipset bottlenecks significantly and that the 2.8GHz does not make too much improvement.  Does anybody know if this is really the case?  I just ordered a 2.66GHz Sager Notebook based on this thought and if the 2.8GHz does indeed give a significant jump, I may just have to change my order.  Also, any thoughts as to whether or not Alienware's Area 51m is tweaked significantly enough to make a difference over a Sager with the same specs?  Thanks

Hello, 

I've been trying to buy a more powerful notebook for the longest.  I came across Sager, but was hesitant in buying a power laptop from them, due to their inexpensive cost, like most, I felt Dell, IBM, and Gateway were the kings of quality.

After reading your experience/article, my mind was put at ease.  You really should get some sort of discount from the SagerNoteBook company for providing such a good review and detailed information about what you went through in purchasing your laptop.  

I will be ordering my laptop sometime this week - Thanks Again.  Hope Yours is in Excellent working order.

Hi Chris, very nice review! I'd like to make a few comments and ask a couple of questions..  I bought a Sager 5620 back in October, just before they released the 5660. It was a P4 2.0 with the UXGA screen and the Radeon Mobility 7500 chipset. The performance was blazing fast, I played Jedi Outcast, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Madden 2003, and several other 3D intensive games at full frame rate without missing a beat, it would be perfect for a LAN party. It also ran Photoshop and 3DS Max perfectly. But, I was unhappy with the screen quality and I ended up returning it. The problem was that there were little 'waves' going horizontilly across the bottom of the screen. If you were looking at it straight on with a solid color screen (like a blank Notepad screen opened to fullscreen) it looked like it got darker and lighter across the bottom of the screen. If you looked a little from the side you could clearly see that the screen was waving in and out a little across the bottom. Sager sent me a replacement laptop and it had the exact same problem. Their tech support looked at some others on the line and determined that its a normal trait of those screens. Have you noticed anything like that on your 5660? The other thing I didn't like was that it doesn't have a serial port and I still have a couple of serial devices that I wanted to use with it. 

Incidentally, I had purchased mine from discountlaptops.com with a cashier's check and they were great, even when I requested a refund (which I promptly received). I would encourage anyone thinking about buying a Sager to take a look at them and talk to Matt there, you'll save quite a bit of money compared to the other Sager dealers. Mine did not have the Sager sticker/logo on it either. 

I've held off in purchasing another laptop since I returned the 5620, and now of course the Sager's have the ATI Radeon Mobility 9000 chipset and USB 2.0. Mmmmm. I'm considering getting an 8886, I'd like the larger screen and the numeric keypad, plus it has a serial port and 2 pc card slots, and even though it doesn't have dual battery capability it has a larger battery and when Laptop Magazine reviewed it it lasted about 2 1/2+ hours, which is not bad for a laptop that size. Someone else commented that they have never seen reviews for Sager laptops in any magazines.. there have been several reveiws for various models in Laptop Magazine, including the 8886 and the 5620 (I dont think I've seen one for the 5660 yet). Both of them got excellent reviews, the only drawback with both of them being size and weight. I am disappointed that cnet.com and zdnet.com haven't reveiwed any of the new Sagers, there's a couple of very old reviews on them, but those sites are 100% ad driven, and there's a ton of Dell, Toshiba, Compaq, HP, etc ads everywhere. I'll bet when you see a Sager ad on cnet.com you'll see reviews of the 5660 and the 8886. Keep your eye out for reviews of Alienware or Prostar laptops too, they're the same as Sagers. All of those companies buy the laptops from a company called Clevo (www.clevo.com.tw) and put their names on it, and in Alienware's case paint it a funky color and put a 5400 rpm hard drive in it. That explains why some people get their laptop with a company's logo on it and some dont. 

Sorry for rambling on.. if you've read this far can you (or anyone else with any model Sager laptop) let me know if you've experienced the same issues with the screen that I described? I may take a shot with the 8886, maybe my 5620 was part of a bad batch of screens, or maybe it only effects the 15" UXGA screens.

Good info. I also, been looking at Sagar, but mostly been looking at Prostar, which has the same line of laptops as Sagar and same mailing address...go figure! 

My question is: If I buy a Sagar 5660 with a 2.4 processor (Im kind of cheap right now), would I be able to upgrade to the new 3.06 and also still have hyper threading? Thats of course after the warranty expires. Would I also be able to upgrade the video card? I work as a 3d artist.

Thanks,

eg, 
To be honest, I don't know. The CPU is upgradeable, however the 2.8/3.0 has the 533 FSB. I think the others have a slower FSB. Not knowing much about the mobo, that's probably changable. As far as HyperThreading goes, the CPU would work, but HyperThreading probably won't work without BIOS support. I don't think there is any word yet on a BIOS update for HT.

Check the forums for any questions or pictures of systems. (on sager forums, 5660 and 88x teardown picturs.) 

I currently own a 5660, through pctorque, the best customer service and the cheapest.

Howdy Folks!
I have a Clevo 5600P with a P4 1700 and want to upgrade the processor.I know that the main issue is over-heating. My current processor is the older 0.18 micron-256kb secondary cache model (socket 478) and I want to replace it with at least a 2.2G running on the 0.13 micron process.
Please advise if this is workable and will I need a bios upgrade as well?    -Thanks.

Hello.
I have been shopping online for an Alienware Area-51m and surprisingly ran across Sager 5654 and Prostar 5660 which all seem identical to each other. 
Are there any differences in performance? I'm looking for the best gaming laptop possible. I'm also wondering if this laptop can handle sophisticated games like Warcraft3, Counterstrike, etc. at superb performance and flawless graphics. I would appreciate a fast response. Thank you !!!

I found this a most excellent review; I've been looking into buying this model of notebook (from various manufacturers including Sager, Alienware, and VoodooPC) for a week or so now, and you answered almost all of my questions.  One additional query though:  when you say the battery life is about 1.5 hrs, is that for a single primary battery, or a single primary + a secondary battery in the floppy drive bay?  While that kind of battery life is probably as much as I'll ever need, I'm curious as to how far it can be pushed.  Is it possible to have a primary and secondary battery in, and when the primary runs out and it switches to secondary, pop out the primary and put in a replacement for even longer continuous battery time?  Thanks again for the info.

All the info you need!  Teardowns, etc, just like Chris said.
Also THE cheapest (www.pctorque.com) place to get a sager.  ANYWHERE.  You cannot find a lower price.

Anyway, the reason I'm putting this up again, PCTorque now has, through colorware, colors (duh) for the 5660 and 8886.  AND they're cheaper than Alienware.  Even the 'new' Chameleon color.  Colorware's even found out that Alienware uses a sub-standard procedure to put the color on.

The batter life of 1.5 hours was for the single stock batter in the NP5660. I would assume that with the additional modular bay battery that time would be double; assuming they are the same rating.

Battery life won't fully get to double, considering it's not as powerful and the laptop drains more as it has to live longer ... maybe around 2 hrs 30 mins?

Do others that have the 8886 or 5660 agree that the processor is clicky and loud? How are the built in speakers, and have you tried recording? Is the audio output clean if you plug it in your stereo?

Define 'clicky'?  The only clicky-ness I had was the 5400 RPM  hard drive. There is an IBM tweak utility that will let you change parameters of the IDE chipset. One of the options has something to do with buffering/caching. Set it to realtime, and the hard drive chattyness went away.

Great review , the kind that put you in the driver's seat and let you imagine ... let's buy that laptop , the 8886.

True and tested comments on UPS versus Fedex...both are great company. 

Living in Montreal Quebec, i look for a dealer in my area , any clue on this ?

Since all those machines come from the same factory , the great differences would be in the service.


Would you recommend a " Personalized System Recovery CD " ? or win XP pro offers the same type of recovery disaster ?

Depends. Officially, if the copy was an OEM copy, it has to stay with the Dell, which I personally think is a crock. If it came as a resotre CD, it's useless.  If you got it in a seperate XP box, you should be fine.

I have purchased 5 sagers and have an 8800 series and the 5660 with the 5400 hd,  the only problem i have had with both is one lit pixel on both,  one was red and after sever nasty call i got a rma #   I just got the 5660 and love it but have a lit blue pixel,  not as bad as the red,  but am tired of any,   i look at a pc all day and anything over 1800.00 i expect a good screen,   i picked it up and it was perfect, after the second day the blue dot of death appeared.   it doesnt bother me so i doubt if i bother with it untill more apprear.  Sager like all notebook companies are cautious and screen issues because of costs.  has anyone had a problem like this with a sager?   I have not had this problem in the other models..

haha, left you a post on the 5660. I have the same brick with 1024 RAM, Radeon 9000, P4 2.8 cpu, etc, etc. 

Are you thinking of installing BSD or linux on the thing? Or have you tried to yet.. Just want to see if I can get feedback from someone with the same specs that I have. 

Also, you should try the Hydravision if you have not played with it yet. Works great on my box so far.

I purchased a Sager two or so years ago.
I am happy with the computer, except for a few things:
1-The case is cheap, nothing solid like a Dell or other brand.
2-It overheats quickly

Recently my problem was the fan - it wouldn't come on. I ordered a replacement part, but assuming the replacement isn't defective, then perhaps that part of the motherboard is fried. Since the fan is kaput, the computer "beeps" incessantly and when the laptop gets hot enough it just shuts down. If I'm not sitting in a wind tunnel, this would be most likely 10 minutes.

Now I am looking into replacing the motherboard, rather than the entire laptop. Why? well, because I laid down about 3 G for this one two or so years ago (and it's just a P III 650mhz) and well, for what I'm doing, the speed is fine (No gaming here)

Since the laptop is larger then most (15.7") I suspect finding a motherboard maybe difficult.

Anyone out there know something about laptop motherboard replacement?

Hi. I , and I'm sure everyone here, would like to know the bottom line: What's the catch in buying a clevo notebook as opposed to an Alienware?  I am also thinking that maybe some of these reviews are just to make the Clevo notebooks look better.  I mean all of you discovered Clevo and then were skeptical about the price tag so in turn sought after reviews.  I may seem like a 'worry-wort' but I need to know exactly what I'm investing in.

Regarding installing an alternate OS:  I have sucessfully installed Debian (GNU/Linux) on my Alienware Area-51m.  There are a LOT of things that don't work, however - won't resume from suspend/hibernate; none of the function keys or hot keys work; rocker pad doesn't work.  I admit that I'm a bit of a linux newbie with only a couple years of experience being away from MicroShaft, so I know that others are liekly to have more success than what I've seen.  There is a guy who has done a lot of work to get things working well with this hardware:

<a href="http://cpbotha.net/clevo5600/clevo5600_linux/" rel="nofollow">http://cpbotha.net/clevo5600/clevo5600_linux/</a>

I plan to follow these instructions and see how well I can get my green alien working, but I'd love to hear of other peoples experiences with a non-MS OS.  I'm especially interested in seeing if anyone is successfully using FreeBSD.

Great review. I just this week found out about these companies offerings in my exhaustive search for laptops that truly can take the place of desktops. The Sager's price is almost too good to be true considering the performance (Alienware's Area51-m is sweet, but at $600 more for a t-shirt and a nifty color doesn't seem to add up for me). One concern though, you had mentioned usb problems, any other Sager, Alien, Voodoo users have same problem? I have 3 external hdd's, ext cdr-rw, dvd-r, printers, mp3 player, get the idea. If the usb ports are iffy, then I would have to look elsewhere. Also, Alien offered a 802.11a &amp; b chip in it's Area51-m. Having both chips in the same box and not having to take up the single pcmcia slot is a definite plus. Thanks.

DATE: 04/03/2003 08:45:02 PM
Regarding USB ports: To my knowledge, there are no reported hardware flaws in the USB ports installed on these systems; the problem is getting WinXP to recognize them as 2.0 ports instead of 1.1. The USB 2.0 drivers supplied by the manufacturers for the 5600Ds series of notebooks produced by Clevo Taiwan (also sold under the names Sager NP56xx, ProStar 5654/5600D, Alienware Area-51m in the U.S.) will not install correctly under WinXP. The reason is that the latest installer engine (v2.40) that comes with the driver bundle is buggy and, in my experience, will actually cease operation after unpacking the InstallShield data. I've seen only two working solutions for this up to now; one being what Chris had described earlier on: unpacking the XP drivers from the CAB archive and installing them manually. The second way is to find the driver bundle that comes with the previous version of the installer (v2.24 - see URL <a href="http://www2.driverguide.com/cgi/download.cgi?uploads14/23187/VIA_USB2_Driver" rel="nofollow">http://www2.driverguide.com/cgi/download.cgi?uploads14/23187/VIA_USB2_Driver</a> Package_V224.zip). The versions of the actual drivers in this bundle are not different than the newest one, only the installer is different so you'll still be getting the latest drivers. Worked just fine for my ProStar5654...

I recently purchased the Prostar 5654 after drooling at the alienware models.  Friend of mine bought the alienware system and now he is kicking himself for it.  They are the same models.

Performance wise the alienware system ran a little faster with some benchmarks, probably due to the fact of some tweaks.

Running Dark Age of Camelot and it looks beautiful.  I would highly recommend these laptops.

The one issue I have is that I have a Microsoft mini mouse in the USB port and it works fine.  But, when I reboot with the mouse in, I get the blue screen of death.  May either have to upgrade the USB or find a driver for the mouse.

I have just ordered a Eurocom 888ES Dream Machine laptop for 3D CAD. Right after I placed the order, I came accross some extremely negative opinions about Eurocom (http://www.davidchun.com/eurocom.html)and I was seriously freaked out. However, most of the complaints seem to date back about 2-3 years. Now I have discovered that Sager, Alienware, Prostar, Eurocom etc. are all basically the same thing (Clevo). In fact, the specs and pictures of the Eurocom 888ES are exactly the same as the Sager NP8887 and the Clevo 888E. There is very little info on the Eurocom, but the Sager seems to be getting a lot of good reviews. Can anybody out there give me some comments on Eurocom and Sager/Clevo please?!?

Eurocom have been in Canada for a long long time and we bought ours because our parents have only ever bought from them. From everything I can see they are very good to deal with. My brother says that they are one of the biggest computer companies in the country. The sales reps are nice too.

In response to Todd's post, I have just read a review on the np8886 which has the exact same TV tuner. They said it was more of a novelty than anything. Check here: <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.html?i=1775&amp;p=1I" rel="nofollow">http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.html?i=1775&amp;p=1I</a> was seriously considering that model because of the S-video INPUT. I am a gamer and would love to be able to plug my XBOX or PS2 into my laptop and have the best of both worlds. Console and PC gaming on the go. Mostly because I am sitting in IRAQ right now and it would be nice to have a laptop or console (or both) for entertainment. I deploy alot and am definately buying a laptop when I get home. Probably the 5670 though because the more I think about it I probably will only take the console or the laptop not both when I deploy. Its a great gaming laptop and a couple hundred $'s less than the 8886 and lighter too. It also had 128mb of video memory vs. 64mb on the 8886/7. So, inconclusion The 8886/7 has a poor TV tuner, less video memory, an MP3 player, which I will not use (already have one), a sony memory stick reader? I dont have any sony devices....You get the idea. Anyway sorry for the lenghty post. I get kind of ANALytical sometimes. Overall I think Sager makes great machines, it's just finding the one with the right features and price.    Hope this helps..

from what i read in www.sagerforums.com, the main problem with sager notebooks is not the overheating, but rather 1) battery consumption and 2) lack of external battery supply. the amount of wattage this notebook eats is amazing. but if you're using it as a portable desktop, instead of a laptop, it should be fine. 

about overheating, it appears that some people have a problem with it, but these are isolated incidents caused by hardware defects. you shouldn't have any overheating problems. 

check out the distributer's policy on dead pixels. for poeple concerned with this problem, apparently most people don't have any dead pixel problems at all, just a few in a batch that get unlucky.

I jUst got the beast 888ESProStar,I am video man and my only bitch is the there is no sofware, I went throgh a company called extreme nootbooks, I have 2 flakey Pixels and I too will never use the mp# player I will use it as a reader for my digital camera. I went for the 60 gig 7200rpm hard drive and a 2nd Battery. This is my 2nd Pro-Star and am very pleased with the performance, My 1stPro-Star was a 2253.
I would recomend this as a professional peice of hardware.All of my Adobe apps work great and I have even played a few games with no problems.

All of the notebook systems are made by Clevo(www.clevo.com.tw) a great manufacturing company for high end notebooks. No matter who you order from you are getting the same system. My advise is do some research and you will find the system your looking for for much cheaper. Make sure your getting the right model, ie. 5600P, 5600D, 5600DS(5600DS supports the new 3.2Ghz with 2mb cache) or 8880, 5800.. etc. many different models to choose from.

Ok, the review looks great etc. I have owned only dell laptops. Some have been good , some not so good....here is my big question.

SUPPORT.... is there any type of next day on-site service? I, in all honesty, cannot afford to be without my laptop for more then a day. I will lose tons of money and customers.

I may have been fustrated with Dell's quality sometimes, and especially the tech support people I have talked to, but when a part needed to be replaced....it was there the next day with someone to fix it for me.

Anyone got any comments or suggestions?

Thanks

I bought a used 8887 (still under warranty) a few weeks ago.  I got my first Sager in 1990.... a 33 lb. "lunchbox".

The 16" uxga screen on this P 2.4 with a gig of RAM is outstanding. And, no dead pixels.

It is so quiet that the first few days, I wondered if it was even running.  The fans are quiet, too.

I had several phone conversations with pctorque.com who originally sold this unit. I found them to be friendly and helpful, even though I was not their customer!

Hope this helps any of you who want a serious high powered system at a great price.

I was wondering what you did with the old Compaq 18XL380?  My wife has one that I am trying to keep running.  Did you part it out, or do you still have it?

Just a note....I purchased a Sager Notebook in 1999 and it died within 2 years.  Turned out the motherboard failed and when I called Sager they told me it wouldn't pay to get it fixed since it would cost me between $700 and $800 to replace the motherboard plus the cost of shipping the notebook to them.  I liked it while it was working....hope you have better luck than I did.  I wish I could find a replacemnt motherboard for it, but not knowing how the inside of computers work, I have no idea how to buy the correct one....oh well, such is life :)

I used to be a dealer of Sager Notebooks at my store and they were an excellent laptop. I personally went thru 3 different models.  The only reason we quit selling them is because you run into so many people who say "I've never heard of them??"  You try to explain to them that these companies manufacture the laptops for ALL the big names like Dell and Compaq, but it flys right over their heads.

Glad people are finally figuring out that Sager is an excellent laptop.  If you want to know more about the LAPTOP INDUSTRIES "little secrets" goto the powernotebooks.com website.  They have a very good write up about it.

LOL I am going to have to get a new laptop pretty soon myself. I have gotten into the bad habit of falling asleep ever night weith my Dell Inspiron 8200 in my lap, and when I wake up in morning, it has always fallen about 3 feet to the ground! BAM!@!!  That reminds of one thing, my hat goes off to Dell (or I should say, the OEM manufacturer of this laptop), this laptop has been THRU EVERYTHING and you can pick it right up and burn a cd or whatever you need PERFECTLY.

Ok, I just found this site by mistake trying to find some information about Linux on NP5600 series...I hope this might help somebody.
I bought my laptop from Mtech 2 years ago. I did some research before that and I reached the conclusion that Mtech, Prostar and Sager sell the same model, just the price is different. Before this one I had a Sager 3380 (if I remember well) which I know for sure that still works... and it was bought from Powernotebooks, many thanks to Donald!
Back to NP5600, it'a P4 2G, originally with 256 DDR, 20Gb, DVD, Floppy, 1400x1050 TFT. 
I have to mention that the notebook came from Prostar, confirming my thoughts about the manufacturers. I was pleased in the beginning, because the NP feels pretty sturdy. My happiness went away after about one month when I noticed some kind of flickering in the screen. I called Mtech customer service, and they told me to call Prostar, since they service both Prostar and Mtech.
After talking to somebody from Prostar, I decided to wait a little more to see what was happening. I watched the screen for almost a year and what bothered me the most was that sometimes when I was focused on something on the screen I could notice the flickering. It didn't happen all the time, just occasionally, and it was worse when I was moving the screen back and forth, but again, not all the time! 
As a computer technician I know that these kind of problems drive crazy everybody in the service!
In the meantime the latch broke, so I decided that it was time to call Prostar and send it there for repair. Another "little" thing was a label on the LCD, in the lower left corner, which was coming out more and more...
I have to mention that Prostar has a 72 hours repair policy. Well, on the website!
After the notebook got there I called Prostar again and talked to somebody, explaining him in detail what happens, when and what to look for. The guy seemed nice and we agreed to talk in 1-2 days. 
I called again in about 2 days and he told me that they couldn't notice anything wrong (that't how it always happens!) with the screen and that they need more time to figure out the problem. He also mentioned that they fixed the broken latch and removed the label from the screen. 
What could I say? "Ok, take your time and fix it!"
But here the nightmare starts. I call again in a few days, and talk to the same guy, and he starts asking me questions about what kind of flickering ,when, like he didn't understand what I told him probably three times before! The story is just halfway, and now it's very late, so I will continue tomorrow.

This is the second part of the article that I posted last night.
I forgot to write that before I sent the computer to Prostar I had upgraded the harddrive to a bigger one. It might not seem a big deal, but actually it was a reason for the flickering in their oppinion! First they didn't want to take a look on the laptop, then finally they decided to do it, warning me that "next time" I should have the original configuration.
Anyway, after another week, I found out that they upgraded the Bios to the latest version and apparently somebody noticed a problem which they say it was corrected by reinstalling the video driver. I tried again to tell the guy that the movement of the screen back and forth makes it worse, and I suggested that somebody might losen the hinges a little, as they can put some stress on the screen. He said: "No, they can't be losen, that's how it comes from the factory. If you want put some WD40 on them!" Great answer, isn't it? I payed $1800 to put WD40 on it! 
After 1 month I finally got the laptop back. It stayed in the service 3 weeks! It worked fine for a week and after that it started doing exactly the same. Even worse, I noticed that the LCD cover was broken in the lower left corner and the screen was moving inside. Besides, they forgot to put the screw that holds the harddrive in place! 
I called them again, and after about 30 min I found out that the warranty expired and they cannot do anything. Although I had extended warranty, it is not covered by Prostar, but by Philips-Magnavox. They mailed me the harddrive screw though. 
I was so furious after the conversation, that I open the laptop completely, till the last screw. I didn't care about voiding the warranty, anyway it didn't really exist! And I opened even the hinges, which were rusty inside (how they got rusty, who knows!?). I cleaned them and put some grease on to prevent them from further rusting. 
The plastic frame around the screen was broken in the lower left corner, and also the cover had a little metal washer that went out from the plastic enclosure, and that's why the screw didn't hold in that corner. So, after checking the prices ($35 only for the frame), I decided to fix it myself. I put some strong Epoxy and after 24 hours I removed the extra with a Dremel tool. 
Since then, no broken corner, no flickering (maybe just once in a while, after the computer comes on from standby, which is normal).
Conclusion: I still like this laptop, because it's very powerful. The harddrive and DVD are Toshiba. It's all in one (floppy, hard, CD), not like Dell either with floppy or CD. The screen is Hitachi, I checked it. So, even though it's not brand name, the components are good quality. I can't say the same about the case, which is not even close to Toshiba or Dell. I opened hundreds of Toshiba and Dell, and I can clearly see the diference in quality...But, if you need a low(er) cost, powerful laptop, I think it's a good choice. Remember to treat it gently. If you need an extra memory, call Apacer directly, they will be more than happy to sell you a 512 Mb for about 100-110, not 160-180 at Prostar. If something else breaks. you don't have too many options: either service (which hopefully will be a better experience), or if it's out of warranty, just to buy the spare part (from Prostar or whoever sells it, because it's proprietary) and to ask somebody to change it. BTW, I have to knock in a wood, it still runs Ok, and it went through hard work: video encodings, 3D design, never let me down. 
I hope this will help somebody. Thanks for reading!

Well, I must say that you guys have done a great job here. Just recently I decided to purchase a high end power laptop, I was initially looking at the high end sony's and toshiba tecra's. Little did I know that how expensive does not necessarily mean better quality. After, I realized this , i jumped on the internet and I have been doing research for the past two months. I was looking at spending like 2.5 my machine,and hey, if you speenfd that much you deserve to have a powerful machine. I never really know about sager or prostar, my roommates even got dells and tried to convince me to do the same. But anyways, I finally made my mind up, I'll be getting a 3.2Ghz HTT, IGig RAM , 80Gig HD,  DVD/RW/CD/RW combo, Internal Bluetooth, Internal wireless LAN, etc. and I intend to run dual OS, Red Hat Professional and Windows XP Pro.

Thanks guys for the reviews, keep up the good job.

Again, I must apologize to anyone trying to actually read this site over the last week. The router I received with my <acronym title="Digital Subscriber Line">DSL</acronym> connection (Efficient  5861) sucks monkey butt. It now sufferes from 3 problems.
</p>
<h4>Issue #1. No telnet after reboot.</h4>
<p>Every time I reboot the router, I can't telnet to it. The reason? The router keeps readding rules to deny telnet form the <acronym title="Local Area Network">LAN</acronym>.  Even after manually removing these rules and saveing the config. They are added again at the next reboot.
</p>
<h4>Issue #2. Ignoring filter rules.</h4>
<p>
In the kernel version SBC upgrade this router to, if will randomly ignore filtering rules. Once it ignores certain rules in the rule set, traffic then gets denies by the last rule (deny all). The effect is, <acronym title="Domain Name Service / World Wide Web">DNS/WWW</acronym> stops working for people trying to connect.
</p>
<h4>Issue #3. Missing filter rules.</h4>
<p>
I upgraded the kernel in the router. Now, instead of ignoring rules, is removes them altogether, causing the same problem for people trying to get to this site.
</p>
<p>
I'm working on getting a replacement this week. Bummer.

However, even though you aren't supposed to be able to get the flu from the shot, it is kicking my ass this evening. I get this feeling I'm going to feel like a corpse tomorrow morning. Flu shots suck. That is all.

Well, after some struggle, the new router is here and operational.
Pretty encouraging so far. The undead telnet rules that wouldn't stay away after reboots are now gone for good. The next few days will determine whetehr the ip tilering rules say put and stop dissapearing. Keep your fingers crossed.

	Not to long after I received my new lappy, I got an email from Donald at PowerNotebooks thanking 
	me once again for my business and asking if i have any problems with it so far.
</p>
<p>
	Way cool. Stuff like that makes me a happy consumer. Did I get an email from Compaq when I bought a lappy? No. 
	From HP? No. From CompUSA? No. Getway? No. Now guess who out of those will be getting my laptop business from now on? PowerNotebooks.

I just got a laptop from powernotebooks too. Awesome service and at 1/2 of the price of any other laptop with the same specs.

<h4>Nugget of goodness #1: renewing a VeriSign <acronym title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</acronym> Certificate.</h4>

<p>
I've done this a million times at work without incident. So of course, this time MicroShat proves me a liar.
It was the usual routine, send in a new renewal request to VeriSign, pay for the renewal, and they send you back a 
nice shiiy, umm..shiny new certificate to install.
Upon opening the key manager in <acronym title="Internet Informaiton Server">IIS</acronym> and trying to install said certificate, you are greeted by a plethora of bad 
password errors even though you know and can use your passphrase on the verisign site.
To add flames to the fire, restoring the old keyset from backups also fails. Welcome to MicroShaft IIS SSL Keyring hell.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, VeriSign iwll let you replace the cert (revoke, resubmit new <acronym title="Certificate Signing Request">CSR</acronym>) for no charge within the first 30 days. I guess this happens a lot.
Once the renewal renewaled cert arrives, it installs fine. Weeeeeee.
</p>
<h4>Chapter #2: File server boot drive 'shits the bed'</h4>

<p>
As if I wasn't having enough fun. Come home, no proxy, no share drives, no tunes. Hmmmm.
Hookup ye olde monitor and keyboard. Oy boy Wally! Hard Read Errors! Reboot into single user; <kbd>$ fsck /. Hard Read Errors</kbd>!
Hot damn! It's a charlie foxtrot party!
</p>
<p>
Luckily, everything important is on raid, and the boot is only 4110MB @ &lt; %50 capicity. Reappropriate one spare 3200MB 
drive, reformat, repartition, reinstall minimal, mount elswhere, tar like crazy, rinse lather repeat.
All is well again; until I buy a new hard drive to repeat the process.
</p>
<p>
This is a great day.....FOR ME TO POOP ON!

I can't wait to get my paws on <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2002/12/simple_and_powe.shtml" title="MT post about custom text formatting plugins">this new MT feature</a>.As many others probably do, I've been struggling with formatting for quite a while.
</p>
<p>
My site is built and delivered using <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> pipelines and stylesheets. The stock "Convert Line Breaks" isn't to friendly to <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Languag">XHTML</acronym>. It's easy to start having problems when you enter a single line containing &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; and the "Convert To Breaks" puts that inside of &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; tags, which is invalid XHTML markup.
</p>
<p>
The only way around stuff like that is to type in ALL of the XHTML into each post which is a lot of work. Plus having XHTML in post content makes content reuse a litle bit harder in place where text only content is desired. Writing your own text formatting handlers will solve this problem quite nicely allowing each situation to have it's own formatting routine.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I'm sure I could write a plugin, and use the <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mtmacros.php" title="Brad Choate's  MTMacros plugin page"><cite>MTMacros</cite></a> stuff from <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/" title="Brad Choate's website"><cite>Brad Choat</cite></a>, but I just haven't yet. And like the article points out, I would still have to alter all of my templates with new/changed tags.
</p>
<p>
Assuming the new formatting selection box makes it into the code, I wonder how they'll deal with changing the format of all previous posts? Luckily, I've got a small amount of posts to tweak/clean/hack/bastardize when the time comes.
</p>
<p>
Bring it on!

<p>
	Day 1 of 365. Place your bets and sit down for the show. In no certain order I set forth the following degree of intents for the day:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Upgrade <acronym title="Movable Type">MT</acronym> from 2.5 to 2.51 - Done.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reapply / Recreate MT patches.</strong>
<p>There are two things that bug me about MT in my situation.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Trackback URLs.</strong>
			<p>
				I rewrite the <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</acronym> on this site to avoid page/language specific file names, make them easy to remember, and
				make them more durable even if the page names change.
				See <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/succeed/" title="Article about better use of URLs">"How to succeed with URLs"</a> and
				<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/slashforward/" title="Article about better use of URLS">Slash Forward</a> over at
				<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/" title="Visit www.alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> for more info.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, <code>/blog/perl/</code> is really <code>/blog/perl.xsp</code>. While all of the links on my site use the
				<code>/blog/perl/</code> method, Trackback pings still send <code>/blog/perl.xsp</code> which means that if I ever change the file name
				, all external Trackbacked links will be broken while all the others will work. I know. I know. I can add another rewrite to remap
				<code>.xsp</code> to <code>.chl</code>. But I'd prefer to just have control over the Trackback URL format to begin with.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, it's time to get all proper and patch the admin interface to allow me to change the Trackback URL before it get's sent. Easier said than done.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think the least intrusive way to do this is to add hooks into the <code>$MTEntryLink$</code>  tag handler to call or use plugins.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ouch.</strong>. I just realized after all this time that my Trackback urls are completely bogus because an Entry's 
				Trackback Id <strong>IS NOT</strong> the same as the Entry Id. To make matters worse, there is no 
				<code>$MTEntryTrackbackID$</code> tag. The only way to get the Trackback ID is via the <code>$MTTrackbackURL$</code>, 
				which uses <code>$MTCGIPath$</code>. Even worse. If your CGIPath/Admin GUI is on a secure site, THAT is the url 
				used, not the url of the local site blog url. :-(
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Outgoing HTTP Traffic</strong>
			<p>
				I love having MT send out pings to the "Recently Updated" list on the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MovableType homepage</a>.
				I would also love to have MT send out pings to other sites in both Trackback and Updated form. However, this is where paranoia kicks in.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a big proponent of <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Egress" title="Dictionary.com definition of Egress">Egress</a> filtering on the firewall/servers.
				In the unfortunate event that a server gets hacked or catches the viri of the week, the server will still not be allowed to initiate a
				connection to an external server on it's own; <b>especially</b> to common ports like port 80 to further spread the love. This cause a problem becuase
				MT Trackback/Updated pings need to be allowed out from the server to anywhere using port 80. Bummer.
			</p>
			<p>
				The solution? Well, in theory, the outgoing ping
				code using the <code>LWP</code> module could be told to bind itself to a different non-default ip/port on the server. The we can filter on the firewall/server to allow
				port 80 from this special address out to the internet port 80. This would allow pings out from MT, but all normal outgoing port 80 traffic on the machine to still be blockedd.
			</p>
			<p>
				We shall see.
			</p>
			<strong>Update</strong>
			<p>	
				Well, the good news is that I patched the docs and modules to add a new blog preference: <code>ping_interface</code>. 
				Now I can specifiy an alternate ip:port to bind to when sending out pings. Once I get my Trackback URLs fixed, 
				I'll work up some patches and submit them to the MT crew. Hey, why not right?
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
If I get those two things done. I'll be happy.

<p>
	Well, I may have not finished the list for today, but I made a big dent and fixed another problem as well.
	I've put together to following sets of <acronym title="Movable Type">MT</acronym> 2.51 patches that may never be of use to anyone but me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>MTEntryTrackbackID</strong> could easily be a plugin instead of patches, but I'm hoping that they might 
make it into the core MT program. If not, then a plugin it will become.
</p>
<h4>MTPingInterface</h4>
<p>
	<a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/downloads/MTPingInterface/2.51/" title="Download MTPingInterface patches">Download Files</a><br />
	As mentioned earlier, this set of patches allows me to specify what local ip or ip:port the server should
	bind to before sending out recently-updated or trackback pings.
</p>

<h4>MTEntryTrackbackID</h4>
<p>
	<a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/downloads/MTEntryTrackbackID/2.51/" title="Download MTEntryTrackbackID patches">Download Files</a><br />
	When circumstances decided that I needed to manually build my trackback urls, I quickly found out that
	the was no <code>&lt;$MTEntryTrackbackID$&gt;</code> tag to be found. There is now. :-)
</p>

<h4>Update</h4>
<p>
	Looks like the <code>&lt;$MTEntryTrackbackID$&gt;</code> code will make it's way into MT at some point 
	in the future. Although I realized today that I forgot to do the documentation patch for the new tag. 
	Doh! Should have that done shortly.
</p>
<p>
	Ben brought up a good point about the <strong>MTPingInterface</strong>: globalize it and put it in in 
	<code>mt.cfg</code>. Duh. Don't know why I missed that one. I'm also entertaining the idea of of adding 
	a setting in there to send pings through the proxy server as well.
</p>
<p>
	Ben also pointed out that there is an <code>AdminCGIPath</code> setting in <code>mt.cfg</code> that 
	appears to solve my problem. I missed it in the the CONFIGURAITON SETTINGS prtion of the docs. <acronym title="Read The Fucking Manual">RTFM</acronym>.

I've been trying to tell people to use w.bloggar for 6 months, and the kids won't listen to me.  I might have given up on the whole weblogging thing if I had been forced to use the blogger.com web interface for one more day.  I eventually changed to Radio, but I don't know how anyone using Blogger or MT can live without this tool.

I couldn't agree more. I've made posting to this site already mor complicated by all the XML/XSL stuff on the server side.

w.Bloggar has made poisting just a little bit more bearable. That, in turn means more posts, more traffic, etc, yada, foo.

After some email conversation with Ben, he pointed out that the <strong>MTPingInterface</strong> hack would be better
served as options in the <code>mt.cfg</code> file
instead of mucking about in the database/admin <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>. So that's what I set out to do this evening.
</p>
<p>
Without further a-mountaindew, here it is: 
</p>

<h4>MTPingInterface</h4>
<p>
	<a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/downloads/MTPingInterface/2.51/" title="Download MTPingInterface patches">Download Files</a><br />
	I also went that extra mile or so and added <strong>MTPingProxy</strong> and <strong>MTPingNoProxy</strong> to mix. 
	This extra options allow pings to be routed through a proxy server and certain domains to bypass the proxy respectively.
</p>
<p>
On a lighter note, this is why I really like Ben and Mena and MT: They're Easy Going. Ben has been 
very helpful so far with my barrage of code questions about how parts or MT work. Kudos.

<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/" title="Visit pepysdiary.com">This</a> is the most creative blogging idea I've seen in a while; It is the <cite>The Diary of Samuel Pepys (1633-1703)</cite> blogged daily, entry by entry as if Mr. Pepys himself was blogging. I think this would be a facinating way to study history. Have a hard time learning the sequence of events leading up to say WWII or The Battle of *, blog it chronologically. I bet it would work.

Now all of the great writers of the past can get in there long overdue "First Post Bitches!".

Well, I decided to eat my own dog food, and install the <a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/downloads/MTPingProxy/2.51/" title="Download link for MTPingProxy patches">
<strong>MTPingProxy</strong></a> patches on the live server. The install went without a hitch. 
Once I opened up the firewall however, only the first of all pings made it out the door. Easy fix for once.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>
@LWP::Protocol::http::EXTRA_SOCK_OPTS = 
   Addr  => $localaddr,
   Reuse => 1
);
</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>Reuse => 1</code> part was the key. The <code>ip:port</code> socket from the first ping wasn't released for 
the second ping could bind to that same IP:PORT I suspect this is a scope issue with each 
<code>LWP::UserAgent</code>. This problem would've only effected people who used <code>PingInterface IP:PORT</code> 
instead of the recommnded <code>PingInterface IP</code>
</p>
<p>
Now it's time to fix my Trackback links. :-)

I decided it was time to get a new more powerful UPS for the <a href="/blog/images/hardware/server_rack.jpg" title="Picture of my server rack">server rack</a> here in the office.
The currently has (3) 1U <acronym title="Pentium III">PIII</acronym> servers (<acronym title="World Wide Web">WWW</acronym>, <acronym title="Domain Name Service">DNS</acronym>, Firewall), (1) 4U dual PIII file server, and a small assortment of switches and nicknacks. So far, I went cheap on the UPS in the rack. It's a simple floor model <a href="http://www.conextproducts.com/ups/product.cfm?sku=CNB900" title="Conext 900AVR product details page">Conext 900AVR UPS</a>. Conext appears to be a rebranded APC UPS. It even came with APC PowerChute and APC labeled cables. OF course, it was nearly half the price of something comparable from APC. Go figure. But I digress.
</p>
<p>
So I've been to Best Buy more than a few times. I tend to buy stuff online since it's always cheaper than Best Buy, but shipping in this 1500AVR would probably suck butt, so I opted for the instant gratification. I've seen the <a href="http://www.cyberpowersystems.com/1500avr.htm" title="CyberPower 1500AVR UPS product detail page">CyperPower 1500AVR</a> in there a few times, but never felt the urge to purchase one those days I guess. Apparently today I was in the mood for a new toy.
</p>
<p>
Once installed, a review may be forthcoming.

OK, I can't take it any more. I have to tell someone. :-)
</p>
<p>
For those who know me well enough, they will probably tell you that I'm a teddy bear pretending to be a hard-ass-bastard. A boy can dream can't he?
I'm is/was fortunate enough in this world to have wonderful parents who raised me and put me through college, a great <a href="http://margeauxsplace.com/" title="The girlfriends home page">girlfriend</a> [yes people, she <em>is</em> real] who can't keep her hands off of me, and a great job [aside from the usual bitching about work in general] that is fun and pays well.
</p>
<p>
Every now and then, I will just do something kind for a stranger for no reason. Call it stocking up on positive mojo. Sure, part of it is that it makes <i>me</i> feel good, but the way I figure it, that is a good kinda of selfishness.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Snowed in at the Radisson</strong>
<p>
For Christmas, Margeaux and I went to my parents house on Christmas Eve and stayed until about noon. That's about an hour trip south of here. From there we drove up to her sisters house which is about an hour back plus another hour. It had already started to snow hard. By the time we were ready to come home that evening, the roads were a mess. It took us almost 2 hours on the turnpike to make it just a couple of exits. Clearly, it was time to get off the roads and snag a room somewhere. I always wanted to try Radisson, so we did. Check in, surf the TV to see what's available. High Speed internet access and I let <a href="http://66.72.53.129/blog/archives/entries/000039/" title="A review of my new Sager NP5660 laptop">my lappy</a> at home. So to the bar/restaurant downstairs we went. Dinner was great. Prime Rib Buffet. Yummy.
</p>
<p>
Total Bill:    ~$60.00
Total Tipage:     ~$40.00
</p>
<p>
Hey, it's just green paper with dead guys on it, and you can't take it with you. It was a slow night, so I'm sure the tip helped her out.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<strong>Lunch at Applebees</strong>
<p>
On any given weekend, we tend to hit the mall, grab some lunch, go to Borders or Best Buy or some such place. The weekend after Christmas we went to Applebees for lunch, and that urge stuck again. :-) We looked around for a bit and picked a family of 6; 4 kids, mom and dad having lunch together. Then we called our waitress over and sat her down, along with the waitress of the family we picked.
</p>
<p>
	<cite>"See that family of six over there?", "Yes", "Bring us there bill. Don't tell them it was us. Make something up."</cite>
</p>
<p>
Total Bill:    ~$55.00
Total Tipage:     ~$40.00 / 2 waitresses.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
But don't tell any one. If this should get out, it will ruin my image.

I've broken something in my patching frenzy. When you click on comments under each post, you go to the comments form. The form posts correctly and the comment is stored, but the page tries to go somewhere else. I think this is related to my <code>CGIPath --> AdminCGIPath</code> change in <code>mt.cfg</code>. Sorry about that. Looking into it now.
</p>

<h4>Update</h4>
<p>
It is indeed because of my changes to <code>mt.cfg</code>. If I leave <code>CGIPath</code> set to the absolute admin gui url, all is fine. If I set <code>AdminCGIPath</code> to the full path of the admin gui, and set <code>CGIPath</code> to the relative patch to <code>/cgi-bin/</code>, the comment template chokes. Actually, it redirects to <code>/mt-comments.cgi</code> instead of <code>/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi</code>. I'm willing to bet this is an issue with the <code>CGIRelativeURL</code> handler in <code>lib/MT/Template/Context.pm</code>. We shall patch an see.
</p>
<p>
I'm sure I could just fix this by making <code>CGIPath</code> a full url incliding http://, but something feels wrong about hardcoding a domain name in there.
I think patching the handler to return the entire entry if it doesn't start with http/https is what the method is really after anyways.
</p>

<h4>Update Redux</h4>
<p>
It looks as if this problem is just a little more in depth than I first thought. Changing the <code>CGIRelativeURL</code> handler had no effect. Why?
Some things seem to use <code>CGPath</code> instead for no good reason that I know of. Awaiting an email response from Ben about how he would like to handle it, then I'll get to work.

Look at what the s.o. <a href="http://www.xmradio.com/catalog/product_detail.jsp?id=28449&amp;type=Tuner" title="XM SKYFi Radio product details page">got me for Christmas</a>. Pretty damn cool really. $9.95 a month. Tons of channel and genres. I mostly listen to the rock and comedy channels, but occasionally I'll slip over to CNN Headline News or the classical side for a change. I bought a home kit for it and have it plugged into my sound card via line out/line in to listen to music while working at the computer.

So what did she get? Diamond and ruby earings and necklace to go with her ring. Fair trade off isn't it? :-P

I simply don't use Internet Exploder any more, esp. after Mozilla 1.0 went final. Why? Two very simple yet stunningly pleasing reasons.

<ol>
<li>
<strong>No virus of the week concerns</strong>
<p>
Don't get me wrong. If you own a PC, connect to the internet and <em>don't</em> have Norton AntiVirus or another like product installed, you should be taken out back and put out of our collective miseries. I'm so sick if seeing another MicroShaft Internet Information Server or Internet Explorer user trying to infect my machine in the logs. Come on. How long has Nimda and Code Red been out? Get with the fucking program people. I can surf using Mozilla, happily confident that there are much much less security issues with it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Four Words: Middle-Click New Tab</strong>
<p>
Yeah, I know IE can use a 3rd party addin for tabbed browsing (See #1 above), but I simply can't function on the web without tabbed browsing in Mozilla.
Rock on Moz.

I always find it interesting that people are bashing IE....I've tried a few different browsers (IE, Netscape, Mozilla), along with different version of each.  IE is by far my favorite, and I don't run any anti-virus software on my computer. I've been surfing the internet heavily for the past 6 years or so and have yet to have a problem. (Knock on wood)

Day 5 of 365. Care to wager?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Install new <acronym title="Uninterruptible Power Supply">UPS</acronym>. Done.</strong>
<p>
	This went pretty smooth. (4) servers, one PC w/ monitor, speakers, etc, and it's still only at half load. Not bad at all.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<strong>See <acronym title="Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers">LOTR: TTT</acronym>. Done.</strong>
<p>I swore to myself I wasn't interested, but I got roped into seeing <acronym title="Lord of the Rings: Fllowship of the Ring">LOTR: FOTR</acronym> last week.
I thought it was long and boring, but I just can leave myself hanging and miss the upcoming battle scenes.</p>
<p>
Wow was this movie long: 3 hours worth. We arrived at the theatre 5 minutes late and <em>still</em> managed to suffer though 6 more previews, then the Regal Cinemas "Welcome, Safety, Smoking, Enjoy" flick. On to the movie? Fuck no. ANOTHER fucking commercial before the movie. In the words of Monty Pythong "Get on with it!".
</p>
<p>
It was better than the first, but I still don't get what all the fuss is about. Guess I'm just a Star Wars fan at heart. At least Star Wars movies are complete movies with an end. The let's-split-this-movie-into-3-parts crap with an ending handing in the wind drives me crazy. It's like playing Beethoven's 5th and not playing the very last chord.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Server Administration via <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym>/Serial Adapter</strong>
<p>I already have one server setup so I can administrate it via serial connection from the boot screen on in case I fubar something.
Another server has a modem on the serial port, and another will soon have the UPS on a serial port. I recently purchased this <a href="http://www.iogear.com/products/product.php?Item=GUC232A" title="GUC232A USB to Serial product information page">Serial to USB adapter</a> from <a href="http://www.iogear.com/">IOGear</a> and it works great in XP. It's also supposed to work under FreeBSD and the ucomm drivers, so I'll be tinkering with that this afternoon. It appears to be recognized fine by the kernel modules, not the trick will be to set it up so if works as soon as possible after the machine is turned on.</p>

Hi Christopher,

Thanks for the ping. Never seen your weblog before, but I like it so I was
wondering if you had an rdf- or xml-feed in there somewhere? I noticed
you're using MovableType so I assume you do, couldn't find it anywhere
though..

I would have sent this in an email to you instead, if I could find it anywhere.. ;-)

No, actually I don't have any feeds. I never got around to making a template for MT since my site is already XML underneath, it should be easy.

Tell ya what, it's on the list tonight just for you. :-)

I needed some new tunes this week. Mostly old stuff, and some new stuff from older bands.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Edgar Winter: The Best Of Edgar Winter</strong>
<p>
I bought this album for one song and one song only: <strong>Frankenstein</strong>.
If of the coolest rock type instrumentals with a great wind/brass section IMHO.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<strong>Primus: Sailing The Seas Of Cheese</strong>
<p>
I heard <strong>Tommy The Cat</strong> on the new <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000078/" title="XMSKYFi radio product details">XM SKYFi Radio</a> and remembered that this was missing from the <a href="/music/?artist=36">Primus albums I already have</a>. My college roomie got me into Primus, along with King Crimson and Brand X.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<strong>Iron Maiden: Brave New World</strong>
<p>
I've always been a huge Iron Maiden fan. I used to have every cassette, and now I'm trying to get every CD.
I'm not sure what it is about them. Maybe it's just that their songs were more story like than the usual hair band dribble. Of course, I really dig Eddie and the album cover art over the years.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<strong>W.A.S.P.: Inside The Electric Circus</strong>
<p>
One of the more hard core rock bands of the 80s IMHO. Not quite death metal or anyhting, but still more aggressive than the usual Warrant/Bullet Boys junk.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
One of these days I need to finish ripping my CD collection and get it's info into the <a href="/music/" title="Browse my music collection">music</a> section of this site. That should go quicker now that I have a lappy with 2 <acronym title="Compact Disc Rewritable">CD-R</acronym> drives, a desktop with 2 CD drives, and 2 more drives in the file server.

More surfing goodness. I found <a href="http://jogin.com/blog/archives/000183.php" title="Post about proper html markup">this post</a> over at <a href="http://jogin.com/blog/">jogin.com</a>. I feel our pain brother.
I've made it part of my mission at work to get our pages to be standards compliant. When a fair amount of your designers are GoLive users, this isn't such an easy task. Don't get me wrong. I think they are talanted people. But I also think it's time to cast off tools that don't make compliant code. It is also time to give Netscape 4 the big Fuck Off.
</p>
<p>
When I started this site, my main goal was to eat my own dog food. If my site wasn't standards compliant, at least in <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>/<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> terms, then I couldn't quite convince people at work now could I? There still isn't a day that goes by that I hear the worst queston ever:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>"What about Netscape 4?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Time to move on people. 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		"But the usage stats show a high percentage of Mozilla 4!. We can't piss off any customers."
	</p>

No. The usage logs show assloads of Internet Explorer 5-6 browsers that still put <strong>"<em>Mozilla/4.0 (compatible</em>; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)"</strong> as their user agent? What the hell is up with that shit still in 2003? As far as customers. Yeah, it sucks to piss off customers. But the logs don't lie. And as the Zeldman camp says, we need to develop for future compatibility, not past compatibility. Of course, Nutscrape for and the HTML hacks aren't even backwards compliant, so what's your point.

My site stats so far on a few sites are showing about 1/2% of the traffic is using Netscape 4

First off; thanks Christopher. Can't say I'm surprised though, bloggers seem far more willing to get with the program than the average webdeveloper, maybe because our sites are more significant to us. We present content to be read and used, and returned to, daily. Regular webdevelopers have a portfolio..

Statistics do show that Netscape 4 have about 1% of users, but it's dying, and pretty fast too. Check out these stats; they rather obviously show that Netscape 4 is not a browser to support to the detriment of standards-compliant browsers:

I completely forgot about this plugin. I created it when I was making this site. It's so odd to stumble <a href="http://love-productions.com/mt/docs/plugins/entry/mtdateheaders.php" title="MTDateHeaders plugin documentation">across it's documentation on another website</a>, but I guess it shows how important having documentation into software that small really is.
</p>
<p>
I stumbled  across the above links in <a href="http://unixgal.techieswithcats.com/archives/001874.php" title="Post about MT plugin usage and links">a post</a> on  <a href="http://unixgal.techieswithcats.com/">Unix Gal's site</a>. I'm also part of the <a href="http://www.techieswithcats.com/" title="Techies with cats website">techies with cats</a> club. Two purebred Siamese sisters and two fat black furballs.
</p>
<p>
I guess I need to get off my duff tomorrow night and move it into the <a href="/downloads/">downloads directory</a> and do any necessary code cleanup.
At the very least, I need to get it into <acronym title="Concurrent Versioning System">CVS</acronym>.

I hope you don't mind that I added it to the plugin directory - I couldn't find your URL when I added it this week, so I hadn't had a chance to check your site out - so thanks for the ping!  I'll get your email addy changed in the directory tomorrow :)

For the longest time, I've had this theory about people. A theory in which I know I suffer from, and I believe humans as a species also contend with. Fear is <strong><em>the only</em></strong>  real motivator in behaviour. Wha? Let me explain with a common everyday situation.
</p>
<p>
You're walking somewhere and see a homeless person? How many people look away, or cross the street? Why? Fear. Fear of feeling guilty? Maybe. It could be the fear of <em>feeling</em> something about the situation itself. Fear of letting the world inside because sometimes the world around us hurts our hearts no matter how much we tell ourselves it won't.
</p>
<p>
My girlfriend claims that I'm a good person, a "good soul" she says. Some <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000076/" title="Further examples of my behaviour">recent examples</a> may even prove it's somewhat true, but I still have the same problem. Fear. I am by my very nature and introverted personality. I spent many many years locking out the world because everytime I let it in I got hurt in some fashion. Such is life I think. While now a days I have more confidense and am generally happy about my position in life, fear still creaps in. Fear of guilt. Fear of hurt. Fear of no belonging. Some day I will overcome.
</p>
<p>
What do you think?

     Dear Joe
  
   I'm a fan of Fearfactor and I think I have an idea for the show. I think you should have an episode with just kids. It would be for $1,000. If you have any comments you can contact me at Rstz3@aol.com.

<p>
	After seeing the cat pictures over at <a href="http://www.techieswithcats.com/">www.techieswithcats.com</a>, 
	I decided to post a quick pic of the family members.
</p>


<h3>Sophia. <acronym title="Also Known As">AKA</acronym> "Soph" (1987-2002)</h3>
<p>
	Sophia was Margeaux's companion of 18+ years. She was a sweetheart. Apparently, I was the only guy Sophia ever tolerated 
	being with Margeaux. I got purrs and snuggles from her. And from Sophia too. :-)
</p>
<p>
	Sophia passed away towards the end od 2002. She will be missed.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/offtopic/sophia.jpg" alt="Photo of Sophia" width="175" height="175" />
</p>
<h3>Neiko. AKA "Raspy"</h3>
<p>
	Neiko and her sister Isis are pure breed Siamese Seal Point sisters. Their parents were both champion Siamsese show cats.
	Nieko got her nickname due to her raspy meow. Both her and her sister are VERY chatty cats as most Siamese are. 
	They aren't mean however, at least mine aren't.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/offtopic/neiko.jpg" alt="Photo of Neiko" width="175" height="175" />
</p>
<h3>Isis. AKA "Ice"</h3>
<p>
	Isis has established herself as the queen of the household. She is a very loud vocal individual who isn't afraid to speak her mind.
	What I wouldn't give to have her speak english for 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/offtopic/isis.jpg" alt="Photo of Isis" width="175" height="175" />
</p>
<h3>Babs. AKA "Babsie Boo" / "Boo"</h3>
<p>
	Being the sucker that I am, I snagged Babs and her sister Buttons from county shelter via the local PetSmart.
	Babs is the biggest lover lap cat I've ever met. She is "The Kitty with the Bult In Smile". Nudge Nudge. Rub. Lick.
	She's a little to nice/shy for her own good aorund the Siamese, but somehow we manage.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/offtopic/babs.jpg" alt="Photo of Babs" width="175" height="175" />
</p>
<h3>Buttons. AKA "BillyCat" / "RoboKitty"</h3>
<p>
	Buttons got her name because that's what she attacks: buttons. She is by far the most expensive cat in the house at ~$2600.
	So far, that's one broken leg with surgery including a leg erector set, and another surgery to remove felt she ate. Kitty with the built in seem.
	We love ya girl.
</p>

Have I mentioned lately than I love <acronym title="Practical Extraction and Reporting Language">Perl</acronym>? I do. I used to think it would be hard to learn. It it eay to learn but hard to master. Once I started my gravitation towards FreeBSD and Apache, I have no reason not to start building my site in something like Perl or <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>. PHP never stuck with me because it suffers from the same problem as <acronym title="Active Server Pages">ASP</acronym> imho. That is that it's harder to seperate content from code in ASP, PHP, and even Perl when doing run of the mill <acronym title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</acronym>. That's why I started using <a href="http://www.axkit.org/" title="XML Application Server Framework">AxKit</a>, but that's another set of articles entirely. But I digress.
</p>
<p>
After using perl for a while, converting sites. Creating modules. Creating patches. I find Perl completely and utterly liberating as a language compared to where I start with <acronym title="Visual Basic">VB</acronym> and VBScript (Stop Laughing). The simple task of assigning a string from a set of strings to a variable using <code>||</code> is just awesome. Try that in VB without at least one hoop somwhere beit an if statement or a function. Even more great of the other things: dynamic functions add into the namespace, assigning strings to an array in one statement, etc, etc.
</p>
<p>
I'm simply mad about Perl and I wish my partners in crime at work would give it s try. <acronym title="Perl-ism: There Is More Than One Way To Do It">TIMTOWTDI</acronym>. Indeed.

You read other weblogs right? Well, I read plenty, I don't know exactly how many but atleast thirty. If I were to visit each one, every day, and keep track of wether I've read the latest post in each of them, I wouldn't be doing much anything else than reading weblogs.

I use a "newsreader", or "rss-aggregator", a handy application which subscribes to RSS-feeds and shows me the new/unread posts. That way I don't have to visit a site to know wether or not it has updated, or keep track of wether or not I've read the latest post.

Ain't that neat?

I did a clean install on the test and live servers here without any problems.

</p>
<p>
Still plenty left to do I'm sure. Clean up the pod docs. Figure out how to create a changelog from CVS -> Changes. Decide how to treat revisions. You know the routine.

To those who know me, it's no secret that I'm not a skinny guy. I'm 6'4" tall and am big boned. Not huge, but not skinny by any means.
With that said, I am addicted to food, or rather the consumption of said item. Some people do drugs, some people steal, some people become nymphos. I like eating. It's a simple pleasure in life that I'm more than willing to take advantage of.
</p>
<p>
In an effort to stop snacking on junk food, cola, chips, candy, etc. I decided that I really really like beef jerky. Peppered. Sweet. Hot. Regular. 
Since it's not bread or chips or candy then it can't be to bad for me right? Wrong. I'd forgotten the one drawback to spicy jerky: The Exit Process. :-)

You know the routine; more new tunes. I rarely ever buy music at FYE (Your Your Entertainment, formerly Camolot), so it came as a nice surprise to me that they have installed listenening stations in their stores. Grab a cd, scan it, here clips. Same with movies. Fuckin A. That's how it should be. It actually was helpful when picking out another <strong>Iron Maiden</strong> CD. I hate the CDs where Brice Dickenson wasn't in the bad. Listen to the samples, nope, he's not on that one. Liston to another CD, yup, there we go.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tenacious D: Tenacious D</strong>
<p>
I actually found out about TD via their HBO half hour specials. If you've never heard them, it's like acoustic-hard-rock meets standup comedy.
</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Iron Maiden: No Prayer For The Dying</strong>
<p>
Same stuff. Different album. But I still like them just the same.

Well if you like Bruce's singing talents you might want to check for one of his solo albums, too. During the time after he left the band (returned to Maiden officially in spring 1999) he worked on some pretty impressive "thunderous" metal albums. Go catch "Accident of Birth" and "The chemical wedding". I think even "Accident in Brazil" [live performance] might be worth a look.
Regarding Maiden's latest works, Bruce has not been in the band only for the albums "The X Factor" and "Virtual XI". Actually Bruce was not in the Band for only three studio albums: the 2 mentioned plus the debut "Iron Maiden" which featured Paul Di'Anno as lead vocals. The other two featured a guy called Blaze Bailey as vocals. Although X-Factor has some tracks influenced/written by Bruce, the band has in my opinion never reached its full potential and that "Iron Maiden touch" with Blaze. That might be the reason why he quit in end of 1998 and Bruce returned....
Would be glad to hear if you like the "solos" .
Yours,
Michael

Heads up! I finally got tired of the site as it was and started work and the next major revision.
</p>
<p>
Among the changes are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify <acronym title="eXtensible Server Pages">XSP</acronym>/<acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML </acronym>page schema</li>
<li>Fewer DIVs, more symantic markup. i.e. strong tag instead the bold tag</li>
<li>Move from <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> Transitional to XHTML Strict</li>
<li>Change <acronym title="eXtensible Stylsheet Transformation Language">XSLT</acronym> engines from XML::Sablotron to XML::LibXSLT</li>
<li>Ravamp <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> Layout</li>
<li>Printabe / Text Only Stylesheets</li>
<li>Relative Font Sizing (CSS)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yeah, that'll keep me busy. Actually, because of how this site is constructed, it only took 4 hours last night to get the schema changed, XHTML converted and get the XSLT engines swapped. So consider this an official warning:
</p>
<p>
<strong>This site will be updated soon without CSS layout for a while.</strong> In other words, it will be like lookin at HTML1.

I'm doing most of that myself. But what I'm really after is the download for his smart_breaks global tag plugin. To bad I can't find a download link anywhere on the site.

Thank Brad! I actually found it buried in the MT forums via Google.

So you're going with XHTML 1.1 huh? Brave. :-)
The only thing kicking my butt in XHTL 1.0 Strict is forms. The mind boggles at how comfortable everyone became with abusing them.

I spent an hour before I realized I have to put my input/select elements inside of a fieldset element inside of the form element. ;-/

As I'm sure you have just noticed, this site is very plain Jane. This is on purpose.
</p>
<p>
I am in the middle of a severe code restructure below these pages, most of which is already done. Before I layered look and feel on top of this site, I wanted to get my <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> validation and usability ducks in a row.  It's a lot easier to make sure everything works when you aren't also concentrating on  <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> look and feel. I figure if I can't stand using it as is, then no amount of CSS is going to help.

<p>
Thank you for your understanding. :-)

Indeed. So far so good. Should be easily skinable at this point.
The only snafu with validation was that the MovableType code was putting target attributes in anchor tag of author links, which is a no-no in XHTML Strict 1.0  :-(

Nothing a little quick editing didn't fix.

The comments 'remember me' javascript should be working now. Be forewarned though.

Cheesus my brain hurtz. The accessibility navigation links are now in place thanks to <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_9_providing_additional_navigation_aids.html" title="Tips about adding better navigation to a site">a little example</a> from <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" title="Website about making a site more accessibile"><cite>Dive Into Accessibility</cite></a>. If you are using IE, this means nothing to you. If you are using a text reader, it may mean a easier navigation. If you are using Mozilla 1+/Netscape 6+, select <code>View -> Show/Hide -> Site Navigation Bar -> Show Only As Needed</code>. This will enable a tool bar at the top that interprets the navigation link tags; things like Top, First, Next, Previous, Last. There are also some site-wide links, like Copyright, Author, and Help. If you see anything that should go to somewhere other than where it does, give me a shout out.
</p>
<p>
This is turning out to be a process with a life of it's own. One you get started on accessibility, standards compliance and Doing The Right Thing, it's hard to stop.

Bold probably contributes to the properly capitalized titles looking weird. I think they look more like titles and less like sentence fragments with the capitals. Grammar be damned when clarity is the boss! You're supposed to have a certain amount of latitude with capitalization in titles or section names.

Progress in groves. Most of this site is compliant (for lack of a better term) with the suggestions at <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/">diveintoaccessibility.org</a>. I'm still weeding my way through the Movable Type database double checking the title attributes for the anchor tags, adding acronym tags where appropriate, and adding image width and height. What a night.

<p>
Among the changes we have:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Better page titles</li>
<li>Global navigation access keys</li>
<li>Link tag relational navigation</li>
<li>Help page and accessibility statement</li>
<li>Better anchor tag title attributes</li>
<li>Acronyms where appropriate</li>

</ul>

<p>
We're getting there. And I'm up to post #105. How the hell did that happen?

<p>
Proprietary hardware sucks phat donkey ass, especially when it's expensive.
I know that doesn't come as a shock to anyone, but I felt it needed to be repeated.
</p>
<p>
I've recently come into the possession of some older IBM Netfinity 5600 servers and one EXP200 external <acronym title="Low Voltage Differential">LVD</acronym> / <acronym title="Very High Density Cable Interconnect">VHDCI </acronym> <acronym title="Small Computer System Interface">SCSI</acronym> enclosure. By enclosure they apparently mean proprietary hunk of shit. These were connected to the server via IBM ServeRAID 4-L controller card. By controller cards I mean proprietary  piece of shit. What follows is very frustrating to a FreeBSD junkie.
</p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>
These machines used to run Windows NT 4.0 Server, and were supposed to start a new life as static file servers for the web. They have one internal bank of 5 SCSI drives, and the external EXP200 has a bank of 10 SCSI drives that can either run all 10 drives together on one channel, or in two banks of 5 drives on two separate channels. Two channel operation is what we're after. One channel/bank per server.
</p>
<p>
First operating system of choice: FreeBSD.<br />
Of course, FreeBSD doesn't support these damn ServeRAID cards. IBM does support RedShat and a few other Linux variants. Yuck. No biggie. After looking around, Adaptec supports FreeBSD 4.4+ on 3 of their high end <acronym title="Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disk">RAID</acronym> cards:
the <a href="http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/product/proddetail.html?prodkey=ASR-3200S" title="Adaptec 3200S Product Page">3200S</a>,
the <a href="http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/product/proddetail.html?prodkey=ASR-3210S" title="Adaptec 3210S Product Page">3210S</a>,
the <a href="http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/product/proddetail.html?prodkey=ASR-3400S" title="Adaptec 3400S Product Page">3400S</a>,
the <a href="http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/product/proddetail.html?prodkey=ASR-3410S" title="Adaptec 3410S Product Page">3410S</a>,
and the <a href="http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/product/proddetail.html?prodkey=ASR-5400S" title="Adaptec 5400S Product Page">5400S</a>. Should work. After all, SCSI is SCSI. Assuming the connection drive types are compatible, it should work. So we ordered a couple of the Adaptec 5400S cards.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday we yanked the ServeRAID cards, installed the newly arrived Adaptec cards, hooked the internal drives to channel 0, the external enclosure to channel 1 and booted into the SCSI BIOS setup utilities. So far so good. The card saw the all the internal and external drives just fine. We were able to configure 3 logical drives (containers):
</p>
<ol>
<li>RAID 1 using first two drives in internal drive cage</li>
<li>RAID 5 using last three drives in internal drive cage</li>
<li>RAID 5 using all five drives in external drive enclosure</li>
</ol>
<p>
So far so good. Initialize the containers and reboot into the FreeBSD 4.4 disc 1 install. During boot, the kernel message showed all 3 logical drives without issue without any apparent errors. This is nice especially since the Adaptec driver is part of the kernel as of 4.5-RELEASE. We continued to do a minimal install with all the usual partitions across container 1 and 2, and container 3 (the external enclosure) was made into a <samp>/data</samp> partition.
</p>
<p>
After rebooting the servers, we started getting assload of timeout/drive failure errors. Keep in mind, there were no problems up to and through the install process.
So once again we reboot into BIOS and scan the drives. All drive are fine. Boot into FreeBSD. More errors. To make matters worse, these errors are ONLY on the external EXP200 enclosure. All of the internal drives are functioning perfectly.
</p>
<p>
At this point, IBM pleads ignorant. Not surprising. They won't say one way or the other whether this enclosure is just a bunch of SCSI drives, or if there is proprietary junk between the LVD connector and the drives that requires ServeRAID cards to function. They have a list of SCSI cards that work with the EXP200. Good luck finding that on the website. Their damn website automatically changes my query to  <em>EXP300</em> instead of the EXP200 that I enter in their search box. Adaptec isn't much help either, which I find ironic for a number of reasons. First, we can't be the first to try and connect EXP* enclosures to Adaptec RAID cards. Second, Adaptec MAKES a fair amount of the ServeRAID cards and/or ServeRAID controller chipsets. Go figure.
</p>
<p>
I'm pretty sure it's not the operating system since the internal drives on channel 0 are quite happy. And I'd bet serious money that if the drives were taken out of the EXP and put in another enclosure that simply connected all of them to the LVD connector, they would work just fine as well. Hence, this EXP200/ServeRAID stuff is proprietary shit.
</p>
<p>
So now we're fucked. We can put the ServeRAID card back in these machines and install NT or W2K. There's a real bargain. Or we can install RedShat or some other Linux variant; probably Debian. Better, but I'd have to learn those distros and Linux. I'm really comfortable with FreeBSD at this point. Bummer.

Termination baby, termination.  I'd bet there's a jumper or something on that EXP200 for terminating the busses, which you probably didn't do when you split the bus.  Sure, sure, blame proprietary gear when the problem is just RTFM...

I have a similar problem, ended up with a netfinity 5600 and a EXP15 enclosure, also 10 SCSI drives in the enclosure but only 2 in the internal drivebays. Now of cause I want to mirror the internal drives and do RAID 5 on the drives in the enclosure...

I chase a ISO boot image at ibm.com for a week(wtf mate!) and finally boot it of and I am presented with some Linux/X-Free based intefrace and two disks from the enclosure are missing, instead the disks from the internal bay show up... what is that about?

This is kryptonite, so I pull the plugg on the internal drive bay from the ServeRAID PCI card and plugg it in to the on-board scsi controller, now the enclosure reports to contain the drives that are actually there, but I cant see the internal drives, fair enough, there must be some other wigglet for configuring the on-board card BUT WHAT THE IS IT? is it a menu during POST or is it an application that you have to run from Ms Windows? 

If anyone knows anything that could help me out, please, or the poor netfinity will have to defy gravity, if but for a short while (4th floor into passengerseat of project managers car)

<p>
If you are reading this, then you are probably already aware of the big redesign going on at this site. As part of trying to get this site in sync with the suggestions over at
<a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" title="Guide to making your site more accessible to text/braile/phone readers">Dive Into Accessibility</a>, I decided to tackle the search functionality of this site, or the lack of search functionality as the case may be.
</p>
<p>
The main problem with the search was that it as a standalone cgi wasn't using the same method of page construction that this site uses.
This site is built around <a href="http://www.axkit.org/" title="Visit axkit.org">AxKit</a>, an XML Application Framework using pipelines. In english, that means that this site uses a series of <acronym title="eXtensible Server Pages">XSP</acronym> / <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> / <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language">XSL</acronym> pages to make the final page a browser sees while the <code>mt-search.cgi</code> simple dumps it's output to the browser bypassing all the flexibility and layout of the other pages. Bummer.
</p>
<p>
So, how do we fix this, or pipe the <code>mt-search.cgi</code> output through the existing pageflow? <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Apache%3A%3AFilter&amp;mode=module" title="CPAN page for Apache::Filter">Apache::Filter</a> to the rescue.
</p>
<p>
What Apache::Filter does is rearranged the order that PerlHandlers fire under mod_perl and allows the output from one handler to be filter through another handler.
Now it just so happens that <code>mt-search.cgi</code> can also be run under mod_perl using handlers. I also lucked out in that the current pageflow system can receive input from Apache::Filter. But after some <code>httpd.conf</code> config changes, nothing worked.  The reasons turned out to be threefold:
</p>
<ol>
<li>MT::App::handler was Apache::Filter ignorant. Not surprising. Who would ever need it to be. Just a matter of registering itself with the Apache::Filter module.</li>
<li>MT::App::print was mod_perl aware, but was using the Apache::print method instead of printing to STDOUT. Another easy fix.</li>
<li>MT::App::send_header was mod_perl aware, but if we have Apache::Filter turned on, no need to send headers.</li>
</ol>
<p>
So, with all that in mind I present to the masses <a href="/downloads/MTApacheFilter/2.51/" title="MTApacheFilter patch download">MTApacheFilter</a>, a patch to allow the mod_perl handlers in MT::App be more Apache::Filter friendly.

Nifty, I used a different solution: a wrapper-script. I have a script, search.php, that takes the query and passes it to mt-search under the hood, and outputs the result in the same "template" I use for all my pages.

Cool beans. That works too. Apparently I was in the mood to do things the hard way; again. :-)

Besides, if I'd done it the other way, I never would've ran across to non-xhtml friendly code MT::App was putting out.

For those of you using the search functionality in MT 2.51 and are trying to make your pages XHTML 1.0/1.1 compliant, consider this a heads up.
<code>MT::App::Search.pm</code> kindly sets the check boxes and select boxes for us before it returns the results. Unfortunately, it sets them using HTML. :-(
That means the search output checkboxes will have the <code>checked</code> attribute set and the select lists will have <code>selected</code> set. These of course are not XHTML compliant and this is in the core modules and <strong>cannot</strong> be fixed in the search templates them selves.
</p>
<p>
Here is a patch to remove that functionality from <code>MT::App:Search.pm</code>. I have opted to emove the function entirely as this should really funciton like the comments form does, where this stuff is set via javascript. If you would like a patch the change <code>checked</code> to <code>checked="checked"</code> and <code>selected</code> to <code>selected="selected"</code> let me know and I'll put on up.

Well it took some patching to get working, but <a href="/search/" title="Search this site">search is now installed</a> into the pageflow and enabled. I've added "Search" to the navigational link tags, but I'm not quite sure where to put the real search stuff yet. Probably in the top menu for sure, but maybe also in the sidebar once I see how the layout goes.
</p>
<p>
Be forewarned though. In a continuing effort to keep content and code separate, the onclick events for the checkboxes and select lists are contained within the search.js file, not in the xhtml button code. I've tested it in both Mozilla 1.X and in Internet Explorer 6. After that, you're on your own.

SBC Intellectual Property is the owner of US Patent no. 5,933,841 entitled "Stuctured Document Browser". The purpose of this letter is to advise you of an opportunity to acquire a license to the patents - view patent link at the bottom of this page.:
</p><p>

- We recently observed several useful navigation features within the user interface or your site www.museumtour.com. For example your site includes several selectors or tabs that correspond to specific locations within your site documents. These selectors seem to reside in their own frame or part of the user interface. And, as such, the selectors are not lost when a different part of the document is displayed to the user - see screen shots from museumtour.com enclosed. By sperating the selectors from the content, Museumetour has truly simplified site navigation and improved the shopping experience for its users.

</p>
<p>
As you review the Structured Document Patent you will notice that the above-discussed features appear to infringe several issued claims in our patent. In light of Museum Tours presumed respect for the intellectual property rights of others, we are pleased to offer you a Preferred Rate license under the structured Document Patent - see enclosed rate schedule -

</p><p>
Actual licensing amounts are calculated using SBC's then current Royalty equation. SBC will gladly determine your actual licensing amount if you provide us with your 2002 Company Gross Revnue (their fees are based on how much annual revenue the company does).

 After reviewing the patents and determining wheather you prefer a prepaid license or a recurring annual licence please contact Ms. Jill Walker at 512.231.7008 to determin your actual royalty amount. If you have your 2002 gross revenue number Ms. Walker will provide you with an accurate royalty number and will facilityate the execution of an appropriate license.

&lt;begin rant&gt;
</p>

<p>
Stuff like this pisses me off, so of course, why not write about it in my blog? :-)
</p>

<p>
About 1.5 years ago, I bought Margeaux an HP N5450 Pavilion laptop for school. Knowing how pissy laptops get with age, I decided to spring for the Best Buy extended warranty.
The money we were saving in rebates made the extra cost of the extended warranty a non issue.
</p>
<p>
Well, here it is a year and a half later, and the power jack on the motherboard shits the bed (yes, that's a technical term). Since we got the extended warranty and the HP warranty had run out, no big deal right? Well, not at first.
</p>
<p>
We dropped the laptop off at the Best Buy repair desk on December 22nd. I've had laptops service before. Even replacing the mobo thought the manufacturer shouldn't take more than a week. Well, four and a half weeks later and the tell us the laptop is fixed. Why it took four and a half weeks, I can only imagine but I have my theories. The main one is that they spent that time looking for a cheap power jack to solder onto the same motherboard.
</p>
<p>
Having been down this road with other things, I made sure we fired up the laptop at Best Buy before we left the store. It appeared to work, but the power jack was still a lot more loose than when it was brand new. But hey, to each his own, so we went home.
</p>
<p>
We get home, she plugs the laptop in, fires it up, and logs onto the net. All of a sudden, the laptop clicks and goes dead. No amount of power button pushing of adding/removing the batter will get this thing to boot up. So back to Best Buy she goes with the laptop.
</p>
<p>
Once there, they plug it in and it worked I am told, with the blue shirted wonders spouting something about power surges. Home she returns with the laptop in hand.
We plug it in, no dice. At this point I want to point out that it is plugged into a surge protector. So I let it sit for a while then try to plug it into the <acronym title="Uninterruptible Power Supply">UPS</acronym> in the office. No dice. 
I would also like to point out that the UPS is a CyberPower 1500AVR, that "AVR" stands for <strong>Automatic Voltage Regulator</strong>. Think about that for a second. That means no power surges.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow morning I will try this lappy at work on a completely different power grid. Assuming it still doesn't work, I'm heading back to Best Buy to demand that they replace the motherboard, which is what should've happened to begin with. </p>
<ins>
<p>
Hell, assuming it does work, theres no reason this laptop should be this flakey about power source AFTER a repair when it have no problems for the first year and a half.
</p>
<p>
It may be time for a "<acronym title="Named after my friend Mark who could fix anything with a solder and a paperclip. The MacGyver of computers.">Marky-Fix</acronym>".
</p>

Years ago, I too purchased an HP N series laptop back when they cost an arm and a leg but declined the extended warranty because I had always been taught that it was a rip-off, just additional income for the retailer, plus I had heard horror stories about repair at Best Buy. Well after about two years of hard travelling and a couple of drops, the unit wouldn't recharge the battery. So, I immeediately sent the unit to HP by FedEx. They arranged pickup and returned the unit with a new mobo and a new top which wasn't even an issue, but it had a small crack in it from one of the drops, in 3 DAYS for $289. The laptop is now 7-8 years old and still plugging away , albeit in a reduced role. Would I do it the same way again? Damn right! The Best Buy repair folks will never get their hands on my stuff.

I purchased a Sony Vaio at best buy March 2002, I brought the Box in to best buy cause it wouldn't even boot up and if it did it would only stay on for 10-15 mins before locking up.  Wannabe comp geek behind the desk ask me if I performed a system restore, another freak told me it was probably over heating and the next overly happy cat told me it was the memory.  Feeling just great about the encounter I figured three heads are better than one right. Wrong!  They call me a week later and tell me they couldn't find anything wrong with it and to come pick it up.  I head down there and I ask them to boot it prior to me carting it back home.  So he attempts to and gets the black hole.  Great thanks for wasting my time right.  Well they tell me to come back in another week so they head tech can work on it.  (head tech) hmmmmmm...  After 2 weeks of no call and no nothing, I decided to swing on by.  Guy tells me they can't boot it, and it locks up in bios.  DUH!  isn't that what I brought it to you for, to fix it, not tell me what I told you when I brought the F'er in 3 weeks prior.  So the guy tells me they are sending it to sony and it should take about 2 weeks and hes shipping it off to them that day.  I go on vacation for 3 weeks come back home no calls from best buy.  So I head on in to best by again, and the guy tells me that sony just recieved the box the day prior.  So where did it sit for almost 3 weeks???  in a laundry basket under the best buy counter? Another week goes by no update from best by, phone there is always busy, so I head in again to see whats up.  Guy tells me sony is ordering parts, I ask him what parts, he tells me he does not know...  Well alrighty then....  2 more weeks go buy and still no word, I head in to best buy again, and stand in the cattle line...  The asswipe tells me the comp has been back for a few days.  I asked him why no one called he said they did.  I can't help but refrain myself from jumping over the counter and choking the SOB to death.  Yet I smile and ask what sony did? they replaced the motherboard and the processor he explains in a high pitched overly happy voice.  It was like fingers on a chalk board....    Basically a new box but why so damn long?  Now that I have it home I have discovered that the A drive does not work at all.  I wonder how long that will take to replace that at best buy...

Glad I'm not alone.  I too grabbed an HP laptop from Best Bye on special. Shortly after HP warranty expires unit won't power up. No biggy, I have the BB exended warranty which, as I was told by billy blue shirt "covers everything".  The local store service guy also assured me work was covered.  Also asked if they could fix anything else for me free, remember "everything" is covered.  Off it goes to Chino (Pomona?) service ctr for repair.  4ish weeks later with no call backs I finally find the # for Service ctr and corner a tech who tells me nothing is covered due to 'incidental damage' Incidental who? I ask.  Right there in the no-existent waranty explanation brochure I recieved.  Brochure who? I ask. Sorry, entire warranty is void. No help from the other cutomer freindly mgrs at the service ctr.  They can however repair the non-warranty power cord/pin problem for a mere $1200!  I tell them to put it and themselves in a box and ship it back to my local BB outpost.  After no call back I vist local store to pick up unit and local geek tells me he can't understand, but the service ctr is GOD! And please $28.00 in shipping charges. I expressed my opinion in loud terms (no intercom necessary) and manny the mgr graciously agreed to waive the fees.  Sent 2 e-mails to BB but heard nothing. Haven't been back since.
BTW: many HP's do solder the power pin directly to the mother board.  Also the cord attaches directly adjacent to the heat vent. No wonder it fails in hot So Cal!  2 fixes; HP does direct: 3 major repairs about 2 weeks TAT for around $269. Easier - HP port replicator powers the unit apart from the power pin - $39 on line.

I have a compaq laptop 1800T and the power jack has short circuit. I have taken apart the machine and found that the jack is soldered to mother board. Somebody suggested that I could buy a HP port replicator to work around the power jack. Any ideas?

Please send your suggestion to yliuaaa@yahoo.com.

Thanks.

One of my goals of this redesign was to make this site skinnable by simplifying my code. Well, it seems both have happened. :-)
While I doubt anyone will every write their own stylesheet for this site, the possibility exists. Check out the <a href="/preferences/">site preferences page</a> to change the stylsheet used when viewing or pringint this site, or to specify your own. Of course, since I have CSS turned off for a bit, only your own stylesheets will work for now.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/16.html#body_ids" title="Post about body id tags">this post</a> at <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/">Dive Into Mark</a>,  I've also added the <code>id</code> attribute to my <code>body</code> tags.
</p>

And how fucking cool this is, I'm working on a css file specified in MY cookie prefs without disturbing the look and  feel of others using the site. Damn cool.

Well, ok, it's not exactly a scuffle, but a debate I never get enough of. Fixed font sizing, CSS  hiding, custom stylsheets per browser, and relative font sizes. Mark Pilgrim <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/16/the_one_ive_never_tried.html" title="Mark on mod_rewriting stylesheet selection">decided to try something new</a> (never a bad thing) and use mod_rewrite to send different stylesheets to different browsers. That's certainly one way to do it.
</p>
<p>
T Bryce Yehl decided to <a href="http://www.ntwizards.net/blog/2003/01/16/mod_rewrite_considered_harmful.html" title="T Bryce Yehl on mod_rewrite stylesheet selection">chime up</a> about that approach (<a href="http://www.ntwizards.net/blog/2003/01/16/mod_rewrite_update.html" title="Followup T Bryce Yehl post about mod_rewrite stylesheet selection">updated post here</a>).
</p>
<p>
Personally, my opinion is why bother. So Mozilla treats <code>font-size: small;</code> different that IE treats <code>font-size: small;</code>. I certainly don't care, and I don't think others should either. If your browsers default font size is 12 and another browsers default is 14. Who cares. In most cases, you can change that default. When you can't, get another browser. Worst case (or best in my opinion), change your stylesheet. Hell let users supply their own stylesheet for your site. Isn't that what CSS is all about? Don't like your browsers defaults? Tweak the user stylesheet. Don't have that option either? Get a browser with a clue. And let's not forget, if the site in question uses fixed size fonts, bitch to them too.
</p>
<p>
I decided to go the route of using <code>xx-small</code> - <code>xx-large</code> for font sizing. Don't like that? Well guess what, <a href="/preferences/" title="Site Preferences">specify your own stylesheet</a> on the prefs page, or tweak your user stylesheet. Options. It's all about options.

</p>
<p>
I've got some mixed feelings about this one.Sure M$ blows goats, but even more, why the fuck do these people have ports 1433/1434 exposed to the internet at large?
<em>I know, some people <strong>don't</strong> had their SQL exposed, but most do. Just like most people who caught Code Red don't have a clue they have it.</em>
There's almost never a need for that. And even if you do need that connectivity over the internet, at least change the port to a non default value, and restrict the clients who can connect to a list of know IP addresses.
</p>
<p>
Hey, I'm no security guru by any means, and I've vaught exactly 1 worm in my time, but that's all it took: once. Be paranoid about your security. Take the nothing-allowed-then-exception approach to the access of your internet recourses. And for the love of god, keep up to date with your patches.
</p>
<p>
With that said, I also realize that not everyone know the same things or has the same skill sets. Worms happen. Viri happen. Mistakes happen. Just try to do better tomorrow than today, m'kay? I also realize that patching your database server isn't like patching your web server. If you depend on your database for business needs, you need to be carefull about patching them.

Well at long last, <a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2003/01/28/" title="Opera 7 Press Release">Opera 7 has been released</a>; and it's bitten me in the ass already.
Opera 6 rendered this site pretty much ok, except for the lack of <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>. So I downloaded Opera 7 in hopes that everything would be peachy.
Much to my dismay, it appears that Opera 7 will <strong>not load external stylsheets</strong> in <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags where the <code>&lt;href&gt;</code> is a relative path. Fsck.
</p>
<p>
With this in place:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;link
     rel="Stylesheet"
     href="/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
/&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>
I get jack squat, nada, nuttin, zilch.Change it to this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;link
     rel="Stylesheet"
     href="http://today.icantfocus.com/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
/&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>
and everyone is rendered happy. Fsck. Same goes for any <code>@import url();</code> entries in the external CSS code. Damn it. This is frustrating.
Can any one else confirm or deny this behaviour?
</p>
<ins>
<p>
Yeah, I know, my CSS files have a few typoes in them. To me, that still wouldn't fully explain why it works/failes with a full/relative url.

Yeah, it bites, check out how it kills my home page. Too much spacing above .. I have a 10mm margin above my h1s, it's turning into much more than that.

Whatever. Opera 7 can bite my shiny metal ass ;-)

More on that Opera 7 bug, at least I think it's a bug.
It appears the Opera 7 may renger the page sooner than it should with respect to <code>&lt;link rel="Stylsheet" ... &gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="Alternate Stylsheet" ... &gt;</code> usage. In my case, I had the alternate stylesheets declared <strong>before</strong> my regular stylesheets:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
&lt;link
     rel="Alternate Stylesheet"
     href="/style/css/screen-default-right.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen" 
/&gt;
&lt;link
     rel="Stylesheet"
     href="/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
/&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>
They were in this order due to the way that this site is built. This of course meant the Opera 7 would not render the style at all. The twist to this setup was that if I specified full paths instead of relative ones:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
&lt;link
     rel="Alternate Stylesheet"
     href="http://today.icantfocus.com/style/css/screen-default-right.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen" 
/&gt;
&lt;link
     rel="Stylesheet"
     href="http://today.icantfocus.com/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
/&gt;
</code>
</pre>


<p>
 they would get rendered. After some tinkering, I discovered that swapping their order cured the problem in Opera 7:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
&lt;link
     rel="Stylesheet"
     href="/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
/&gt;
&lt;link
     rel="Alternate Stylesheet"
     href="/style/css/screen-default-right.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen" 
/&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Go figure. Is this a real bug, or is there some unwritten rule about link tag ordering that I don't know about?
</p>
<p>
I see that Dive Into Mark talks <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/28/how_to_hide_css_from_opera_7.html">about hiding CSS from Opera 7</a>. Yeah it's even easier than that. Put your alternate stylesheet tags first. ;-)

I should know better, but apparently I fell under the stupid spell this morning. The plan was simple. Get up early. Update database servers' OS. Update database server software.
Go home early. Praise Murphy, it didn't quite happen that way.
</p>
<p>
Instead, it went something like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Get up early</li>
<li>Install OS service pack</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Install IE SP1</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Install more OS patchs</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Do ANYTHING</li>
<li>Reboot (No wonder people don't update their servers)</li>
<li>Look at the server wrong</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Server hangs at startup. Fsck.</li>
<li>Spend another hour in recovery console finding bad driver.</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ol>
<p>
So much for database service packs. Maybe tomorrow. Let's not even talk about why in the hell Windblows Upchuck fed me the wrong drivers.

HAH, I was searching thru some stuff on Google.com and I found this article.  I had the same problem, but I manually installed the updates.  Actually it was Windows2000 SP3.  Only server for 50-60 users (file, print, Exchange, apps, etc...).  I worked around 30 hours straight.  Went to work at 9am, server went down at 9pm, and wasnt fully recovered till 2:30p the next day.  I recovered thru ' the recovery console, but I also had to do a recovery install.  During the recovery install 'beautiful' Windows Setup decide to do something wacky and just sit there after it decided what it was going to install (components section of install).  Ended up calling MS Tech Support.  When I asked him what was happening in the install he said he didn't know how Windows Setup worked. HAH.  His solution: 'Reinstall'.  THAT IS WHAT I JUST DID.  Ok, I am just rambling now, but I think you understand.  Oh, and Exchange had a whole different set of problems.  I would use Linux if it wasnt for Exchange Craptastic Server.

It's official: Best Buy can suck my left testage. Their lack of ability in servicing their customer or providing service on their extended shams..um..warranties is amazing.
For those keeping score, here's whay happened so far:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchased HP N5450 Laptop + Extended Warranty</li>
<li>Power jack dies after a year and a half.</li>
<li>Take to Best Buy on Dec. 22, 2002 for repair.</li>
<li>Wait 2 weeks. They order motherboard and don't use it.</li>
<li>Wait another 2 weeks. The order jack and resolder the motherboard.</li>
<li>Pick up laptop on Jan 17, 2003. Boots fine in the store.</li>
<li>Return home. Laptop stops working after the 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Return to Best Buy that night. Laptop boots. Got excuse about power surge.</li>
<li>Return home. Laptop still won't boot plugged into UPS.</li>
<li>Remove battery. Won't boot in the morning.</li>
<li>Return to Best Buy for re-repair.</li>
<li>Call manager on Jan 20, 2003. Will "rush repair".</li>
<li>Call repair center on Jan 27, 2003. LAptop hasn't even been touched.</li>
</ol>
<p>
There you have it. A crock of horse poop in my opinion. CompUSA and any manufacturer could have this repair completed in 7 days, including shipping.
So, more phone calls. The latest plan:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Motherboard arriving today, Jan 29, 2003.</li>
<li>Install mobo today ot tomorrow.</li>
<li>Ship back to Best Buy on Thirsday, Jan 30th, 2003.</li>
<li>????</li>
</ol>

<p>
Place your bets. If I don't see this laptop fully functional by Monday, I will become the official pissed off customer in the store on a crowded evening.

I've done some more tinkering with Opera 7 trying to pinpoint the CSS problems with styleshets vs. alternate stylesheets.
Here's a <a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/downloads/tests/opera7/index.htm" title="CSS selection in Opera 7 test pages">test page</a> for the curious. Here's what I found.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
&lt;link

     rel="Stylesheet"
     href="/downloads/tests/opera7/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
/&gt;
&lt;link

     rel="Alternate Stylesheet"
     href="/downloads/tests/opera7/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
     title="Left Navigation"
/&gt;
&lt;link
     rel="Alternate Stylesheet"
     href="/downloads/tests/opera7/style/css/screen-default-right.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
     title="Right Navigation"
/&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>
 In this version, style is applied in Opera 7 when the page is loaded. However, only the Right Navigation alternate stylesheet is appears in the user styles menu. Right Navigation alternate style works when selected.
</p>
<p>
In Mozilla, style renders fine when the page loads. Both Right and Left Navigation alternate styles are in the styles menu, and both work when selected. 
</p>


<pre>
<code>
&lt;link

     rel="Alternate Stylesheet"
     href="/downloads/tests/opera7/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
     title="Left Navigation"
/&gt;
&lt;link
     rel="Alternate Stylesheet"
     href="/downloads/tests/opera7/style/css/screen-default-right.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
     title="Right Navigation"
/&gt;
&lt;link

     rel="Stylesheet"
     href="/downloads/tests/opera7/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
/&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>
 In this version, style is NOT applied in Opera 7. Both Left and Right Navigation alternate styles appear in the style menu. Left Navigation works when selected. Right Navigation only loads the referenced stylesheet in href, but not the stylesheet inside of it using @import.
</p>
<p>
In Mozilla, style is applied when the page loads. Both Right and Left Navigation alternates show up in the style menu, but neither Left nor Right alternate styles work when selected. 
</p>
<p>
All in all, damn strange in my book. Why would you need to declare the same stylesheet as the main styleshet AND as an alternate? Well, in the case of this site, The 'default' style needs to be an alternate choice at all times since users can specify their own stylesheets. If the choose the site default as <em>their</em> default, the will both point ot the same file. Of course, there is a real fix: just make a default preferred stylesheet that simply loads the *left stylesheet, which will be different from the *left alternate stylesheet. I guess I was just expecting Mozilla/Opera to Do What I Mean. Load what I select and don't put to much thought into it.

If was reading <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2003a.html#t20030129">Eric Meyers latest blurbs</a>, and found this little nugget:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'd been toying with the idea of trying to get local Web folks to assemble for socialization and (human-relation) networking for a while now, but thanks to Meetup I don't have to undertake the organizational effort. That's pretty cool. It just makes sense someone named Eric would be involved in something that cool. We're everywhere, and everywhere we go is cool. That's the kind of cool we are.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Being from Akron, and Eric being from Cleveland, he had mentiond  a get together in a passing email. I was just thinking about this again this morning, but maybe something more than a Meetup. On that note, there is no CSS MeetUp, but there is a Web Standards MeetUp. :-)
</p>
<p class="center">

<a href="http://webstandards.meetup.com/"><img src="http://img.meetup.com/img/logo/small/w/webstandards.png" alt="" /></a>

</p>
<p>
You know how local Perl user groups get labeled MyCityName<em>.pm</em>? A <code>.pm</code> file in Perl is a perl module. <em>Akron.pm</em> would be the virtual perl users module in Akron. Kinda cool I always thought.
</p>
<p>
This morning I was thinking the same thing about CSS.  Let's start an <em>Akron.css</em> or a <em>Cleveland.css</em> users group. :-)

The PM, when used for Perl User Groups, means Perl Mongers.

Speaking of which...  I wanted to let you know that I have recently started an Akron Perl Mongers group. Rubbercity Perl Mongers. I found your website while searching for Akron computer groups/programmers. Since you seem to be a big Perl fan, I wanted to let you know about the group.

there is no membership fee to join the group and we'll probably have 2 meetings a month, one technical and one social.

If you (or anyone you know) might be interested I have a brief site about the group at:

Just a quick update to the <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000131/">CSS MeetUp discussion</a> below. <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2003a.html#t20030129" title="Eric comments on Web Standards MeetUp">Eric Meyer has signed up</a> for the Cleveland MeetUp, so I've changed my Akron vote to a Cleveland Vote. Plus, he's giving a presentation earlier that evening at the Cuyahoga Community College; "<cite>CSS: The New Language of Web Design</cite>".
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I've watched word of the Web Standards Meetup work its way through various blogs like a slow conceptual pulse, so I may as well keep it going. I seem to be the only one in my area signed up so far, and I'm slightly bummed that there are cool people like Nick and Molly signed up in cities far away from me. Of course it was only after I signed up that I realized the meetup is the same night I'm presenting at a local community college, so I'd be incredibly late or in absentia anyway. Of course, people interested in standards could come meet at the talk, and then we could all go to a nearby place afterwards. It's an idea. It might even be a good one. You be the judge.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think it's a great idea myself. If nothing, it's an excuse to go to the presentation. I've wanted to meet Eric for a good while now, and hanging out with a group of web standards geeks can't be all that bad. :-P 
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Now for all you web programmer types in the Akron/Cleveland area, get your butts in gear and get signed up for a MeetUp!</em></strong>

Holy shitballs batman. Apparently the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/space/02/01/shuttle.columbia/index.html">space shuttle Columbia has been lost</a>. Tragic.
My guess it that they lost to many protecting ceramic tiles and flamed out during re-entry. So sad. At least the crew probably did quickly without suffering.
</p>
<ins>
<p>
<del>Someone on CNN</del> The news ticker on CNN Headline news just said that something hit a wing on lift off and knocked a good portion of tiles off. Oh dear. If that's true, maybe they knew they may not make it back before they even started re-entry. Bad bad bad.
</p>
<p>
To <a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/space/0301/gallery.mission.guide/content.1.1.html">the crew lost in Columbia today</a>, we solute you for your bravery and may God watch over you.

a former NASA flight controller:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
A sad day indeed....I and one of my co-owners, Jeff Bertsch, work at the
Space Center and are both former flight controllers (Ascent/Entry Guidance &amp;
Procedures Officers). I worked with Wille McCool on the Shuttle Cockpit
Upgrade, which is supposed to fly in 2006.
</p>
<p>
The deorbit burn is targeted with excess energy, so the Shuttle flies about
a 45 deg bank during Entry and does a couple of roll reversals (S-Turns) to
manage the energy. The video shows a large object separating, then a flash
and puff in the contrail and then the breakup. I believe the large object
was the left wing and it was probably during a roll reversal. The left wing
was struck by External Tank debris during Ascent. The wing leading edge
temperature is approx. 3000 deg during Entry.

Yet another entry from the you-know-you're-a-geek-when department. So I'm watching Saturday Night Live reruns on Comedy Central and they had this skit about some firm named Dillion &amp; Edwards with the web address of <strong>http://www.clownpenis.fart</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Funny. So what's the first thing that pops into my head?
</p>

Guess I've been reading to many <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/slashforward/" title="A List Apart article on trailing slashes">A List Apart articles</a>.
God I'm a loser. :-)

Hi all.  I just wanted to say that I was watching the same Saturday Night Live rerun that was mentioned earlier-  the one about www.clownpenis.fart (except the date is September 21, 2003).  After the skit, I immediately entered the web address on my laptop, out of curiosity, and found this site.  It's nice to know that there are others out there with my weird curiosity and humor.  Sometimes I've wondered.  hee hee hee  Now, I am going to check out the authentic www.clownpenis.com.

<strong>Warning: Strong language ahead!</strong>
</p>
<p>
Let's just get this out of the way. Courtesy of George Carlin; <em><strong>Shit, Piss, Fuck, Cunt, Cocksucker, Motherfucker, and Tits. Fuckity Fuck Fuck Fuck. Bastard. Moron. Fucking Retards.</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
Just when you thought Best Buy Service Center couldn't be any fucking more retards, they just may surprise you. For those just joing out program, I bring you the following timeline of piss poor customer service:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Purchased HP N5450 Laptop + Extended Warranty</li>
<li>Power jack dies after a year and a half.</li>
<li>Take to Best Buy on Dec. 22, 2002 for repair.</li>
<li>Wait 2 weeks. They order motherboard and don't use it.</li>
<li>Wait another 2 weeks. The order jack and resolder the motherboard.</li>
<li>Pick up laptop on Jan 17, 2003. Boots fine in the store.</li>
<li>Return home. Laptop stops working after the 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Return to Best Buy that night. Laptop boots. Got excuse about power surge.</li>
<li>Return home. Laptop still won't boot plugged into UPS.</li>
<li>Remove battery. Won't boot in the morning.</li>
<li>Return to Best Buy for re-repair.</li>
<li>Call manager on Jan 20, 2003. Will &quot;rush repair&quot;.</li>
<li>Call repair center on Jan 27, 2003. Laptop hasn't even been touched.</li>
<li>Motherboard arriving today, Jan 29, 2003.</li>
<li>Install mobo today ot tomorrow.</li>
<li>Ship back to Best Buy on Thirsday, Jan 30th, 2003.</li>
</ol>
<p>
As if my fucking patience isn't thin enough already, here are tonights events:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Best Buy called today, Monday, Feb. 3rd, 2003.</li>
<li>Arrive at store. Laptop is there. <strong>They forgot the fucking power adapter!!!!!!</strong>. Now keep in mind, they asked for the power adapter to be sent with the laptop this time. It's in the computer and on the packing list when it was sent. And of course, the repair checklist was check marked and verified on the "verify accessories" option.</li>
<li>After numerous "nothing I can do" excuses, they "find" an adapter.</li>
<li>Plug it in. Power it up. It <em>appears</em> to work.</li>
<li>Return home.</li>
<li>Plug laptop in. No fucking sound. I should've checked at the store, but I figured it was at 0% volume where we usually leave it.</li>
<li>Shut down laptop. Try turning it on and using the front panel controls as a CD player. Nothing. <strong>Not one fucking thing on the front display works.</strong></li>
<li>Call Consumer Relations at 1-888-BESTBUY (1-888-237-8289)</li>
<li>Talk to tier 1 idiot. Ask for manager.</li>
<li>Talk to manager. "Take it back for them to check". Yeah, wait for them to ship it back to their service center for another 2 weeks. Fuck you.</li>
<li>Won't give me Regional Supervisor name. Click</li>
</ol>

<p>
Needless to say, I'm very pissed. It is very apparent that Best Buy doesn't give a fuck about their customer service. It is also apparent that there is only one way to get this issue resolved.
Go to the store and speak to the store manager, loud enough for customers to hear and see my displeasure.

Start filing complaints everywhere you can find to file one. Did you pay for it with a credit card (more importantly, are you still paying on it)? If so you might be able to get them involved (unless of course you bought it on a Best Buy card). The Better Business Bureau can't do anything directly, but you can add to the probably already large list of complaints against them. And of course you should also call and write the corporate office of Best Buy and ream a few of them.

I thought your first impulse regarding the manner in which you intend to deal with the chain of events that occured in February was a rather intelligent idea. It proved to be extremely effective when I had similar problems with Best Buy.(Now referred to by members of this house hold as "Best Try Frys")

I agree that you have been treated wrongly, needless to say, one Best Buy store dosn't speak for the entire chain. I have had service plans and they are great about it. We all have to be patient. They will get it fixed eventually and I bet if we continue to be assertive yet reasonable, all our problems well be fixed! Thanks

I think you are not alone in the big world of nasty service by Best Buy - I have got a 50inch Toshiba HDTV which stop working and called the idot help desk of Bestbuy and they informed me that it will take 1-2 weeks for somebody to come to your home to check it and further the service center has got 6-8 weeks of back log and cannot service, so that tell you my frustration that I cannot have TV for next 6-8 weeks(If I am lucky) and the GREAT PSP plan is just to suck money out of you and did not ensure you any service deadlines. Customer service sucks --dont give you any options to provide you temporary replacement so that you can watch TV for next 8 weeks and then they got nerves to tell me that you can stay without TV for next 8 weeks. I wish somebody somewhere look into them and do something.

File a formal complaint like I did at <a href="http:///www.bbb.com" rel="nofollow">http:///www.bbb.com</a> and have them investigated.

Everyone that has had a problem needs to, it's the only way they will stop getting away with it!
Also, contact <a href="http://newsnet5.com" rel="nofollow">http://newsnet5.com</a> go to consumers and consumer alert, troubleshooter and send them your info. like I did, we need to team up and see how they like it.

D00d, I sent my laptop to bby for repair because it would lock up and not boot about 98% of the time. I tried to fix the problem for the longest time because(being a former in store service tech, later mobile audio tech) i knew it would take FOREVER to get it back and threaten national security if bby got their hands on MY LAPTOP!!! So after months of no progress, and more and more problems like pretty yellow lines across the LCD, i decided to forfeit and i walked into the mercy of the mighty tech bench at the local best buy with a white flag held high. After saying Hi to all the people I USED TO WORK WITH there I asked them if they had my laptop, welllll finally they did after a month, but thats expected return time. So it was nice to know that my PSP paid for a new LCD, a new hard drive, and anew DVD/CD burner. There it paid for itself right away, and i did NOT have to go through the manufacturer which whould have taken god knows how long.  But the bad news was, the latch that holds the laptop closed was broken when they replaced the screen.. =( whatever, didnt really care, and they added another sicker to my collection, but to my expectations THEY LOST MY #$%^#@^% POWER SUPPLY AND THE RESTORE CDS!!! OH GOD!!!, but i didnt really care for the restore CDs in the first place, but i would have thought they would have least used them to insall the operating system back on the laptop before they sent it too me in the even that they had to replace the hard drive, which had LINIX!!! on it... so instead of replacing the hard drive and running the restore CDs, they put DOS on there... oh yeah and it still doesnt power on, i have to put it on its side to start it, and if you bump it... it locks up. I would say its just karma because i was a service tech, but.. its not, because its not theyre fault at the store, they just record the information that you give them, and send it to the service center, the service center gets hundred of orders in every day. Some where between them "fixing" each and every order and them shipping stuff back to the RIGHT store... something paranormal seems to be occuring because from my experience from working there, this was exactly the experience that i was expecting, which cant be what bby wants. Because they WANT you to have a good experience with them so you will come back to spend more money and put circuit city out of business, its called their loyalty one scores. So each store tries to do thier best BUT something somewhere is sabbatoging thier system!! ITS A SHADOW BBY GOVT OR SOMETHING!! THEY PULL OVER THE TRUCKS AND RELEASE SWARMS OF NANO MACHINES TO SCREW YOUR STUFF UP!!! .... nooo wait a min.. that cant be true, maybe its the girl scouts..... ... . .. nope gotta be from bad order of operations... thats it, somewhere in there the guy who checks in the order and the guy who repairs it and send it back to the guy who ships it, they lose you things. (to ebay?) lol wellll im off topic.
ANYWAY one last point, is that all the while your stuff is getting fixed for free (under PSP) and your getting beter turn around time than the manufacturer, you are scoring big time everytime your stuff has to go off for repair.. its called the NO LEMON POLICY!!! Now in my case i am going to have to send my laptop in again to fix this weird on its side starting behavior. THIS will count for a second time that my laptop was SENT to the service center and had parts REPLACED OR REPAIRED, after its sent in to have parts REPLACED OR REPAIED THREE TIMES, and it is sent in a fourth time and it is confirmed that it needs to have parts REPLACED OR REPAIRED, then they call the regional district supervisor surgon generals secretary to get the number to the Seasonal Part Time Corporate No Lemon Authorization Specialist to get go codes and the activation keys for the NO LEMON POLICY, then they mail one key to your store and they turn them at the same time in thier inventory liquidation management software key interface in order to make you order go INSTANTLY from the service center to your store without any extra units floating around, and then there the store has succesfully been authorized and bleesed to give you a NEW COMPARABLE UNIT. Which in the event you have a computer..... your going to get something far better than you had because they dont keep OLD computers in stock. oh yeah, GIG `EM SOONERS err BEARS!!

It sux that this has happent to u and apparently others grrrrrrrrr. And "former employee of bby", I got a kick of out your comments ROFLOL. I've purchased a few things from my local best buy and fortunately have not yet had any problems, phew.
However, I, like anyone else has made purchases even substantial ones and it turnt out to be crap and I had trouble getting repair, replacement or refund.
I really think that better organization, knowledgeable ppl and better working environments would help cut down on the amount of time it takes to get things done and done right.
I mean, if u have an 18 wheeler backing up to the door w\ things that need servicing and thats jus stuff that came in to the store Saturday and Sunday, and u have hm, maybe 5 ppl at the service center to work, one proly a manager, 2 r the receiver and shipper, that leaves u one qualified servicer and one trainee, hmm...not quite the ideal situation.
Furthermore, if the things that we buy or that r used (including replacement parts) werent such CRAP (that to your NAFTA CAFTA and beyond) then we wouldnt have to have month to year+ long headaches.
IN my opinion, its not just the fault of one business, one person or a handful, its a collective effort of greedy, moneygrubbing, lazy, dishonest, theiving scumbags driven by their selfish desires, rather than higher standards of quality and care for the whole.

You people are morons!  First off...if you don't buy a service plan, you are at the mercy of the manufacturer.....their 1 year LIMITED warranty.  Manufacturer....there's something to think about.  Best Buy does NOT make the crap you buy.  You're lucky they offer a service plan to make your life easier......boneheads.  What would you do if your precious human error-made laptop broke and HP or EcrapMachines or Comcrap was the only company to go to???  I'll tell you....they would screw you past Wednesday to help you so you better be happy there's a company out there that will override the MANUFACTURERS CRAPPY 1YR WARRANTY!!!  Babies.

Motherfuckers make EVERY excuse in the book not to replace your stuff.  NEVER EVER buy an extended warranty.  I've gotten the runaround for the following items:

1.  laptop
2.  fridge
3.  wireless keyboard
4.  ipod
5.  television

FUCK THEM.  NEVER buy a warranty, it is a WASTE OF MONEY.  come to think of it, don't even buy from them...use amazon, newegg.com, officemax, staples, there are a ton of alternatives...

So the girlfriend calls Best Buy today to see when the store or general manager was on duty. In a nutshell, she was told the we were 'lucky to be Best Buy customers' and we were 'lucky to have a Service Plan' and that their repair folks are 'the best team there'. Who the fuck do these people think they are? They said that the general manager would we there on Thursday and was not there today. (See below. This was a lie.)
</p>
<p>
I've known quite a few people that worked at Best Buy, one of which actually did laptop repair. No staff. No training. Just 19 year olds who fuck up hardware and leave it to the older people to salvage.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to explode I swear.
</p>
<p>
First, I don't care what the excuse. As a customer, I should not have to sit and wait for the 3rd repair in 6 weeks because their repair personnal are not compitant. Then this "there's nothing I can do attitude"  is complete bullshit.
Customer relations could fix this  with one phone call. The store manager could fix this on the spot. 
</p>
<p>
And to that little prick [Adam] working behind the repair counter last night, there IS something you can do. Take pride in your fucking work, and in the company you work for.  The company name on your badge is the same as the repair center. Best Buy. If your company is as retard as they seem, speak out. At the very least, make a fucking effort to keep the customer happy and act like you care. <em>That</em> is what you can do regardless of whether you do actual repairs or not.
</p>

<ins>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>
So I've dropped the laptop off for repair #3 in the last 6+ weeks. At least this time, Adam was nice compared to last night. I had no energy left to argue after a day of stewing with blood pressure that was god-knows how high.
They've coughed up a $50.00 gift certificate, but chances are i may never spend it if they continue to drive me over the edge. Regardless of how this turns out, Best Buy, BBB, and HP will receive letters from me on the matter.
</p>
<p>
At this point, I think I'll
let them hang themselves. If the laptop returns yet again with functional deficiencies, they will have no excuses and no recourse. We shall see.
</p>
<p>
By the way. When I arrived at the Best Buy, I saw a friend who works there. Guess who has been in the store all day? The general manager. Nice lie Best Buy.

In 1996 we had them install some more memory in our computer.  It took them over 10 different trys to find the right type that would work in the Compaq, thats when I decided to learn to do it myself.  Needless to say that was the last time they did upgrades for me.  Now I'm building my own computers...

Sorry for the 2nd post but I was rereading and thought "duh"!  My friend just got a HP laptop and the power jack broke on that one too.  He took it back to Sams Club and just got his money back.  Sounds like this isn't a fluke.  I'm also betting they know more about the problem then they are leading you to believe.

Best Buy blows... you should remind them of their 'lemon' clause... (it's been a while since I worked there, but I'm pretty sure I'm not imagining this...)  I swear there is a clause that says basically, "if it doesn't work, and 'repair' can't fix it, exchange"... 

The best thing would be, get ahold of someone in Customer Service, ya know the return/exchange counter.. and just say, "Look, I know your policy, but this is the third time this has had to come in for service, I know that you can send it back 'DEVO' and give me a new one, and you get compensated for that from the dealer, so how about we save time, and energy and do THAT this time, and then you don't have to loose a customer."

something to that effect.. but the term you want to throw in is "DEVO".. it doesn't take 'em anything to do it, and they don't loose any money.. Hell, a buddy of mine worked as a computer tech at best buy for a while, and he said they would occassionally have some RAM that wouldn't be working 100% so they would just fry it out with a power-supply, and then send it back Devo, and replace it with new stuff, mainly because it was EASIER, and more cost effective, because they weren't wasting all their time on something that had become hopeless.

Call customer service huh. I wish. That's where I get really pissed. I've called corporate. I've called Customer Relatons. I get the same attitude. "Nothing I can do". "Take it back in". No one at the store, manager level, corporate, nor customer relations gives a shit.

I'm taking the short rope approach. They WILL screw up this repair somehow. They they will have no excuses on the 3rd time in 7 weeks.

I just noticed your girlfriend's comments on the Big brainwashed box website, I can tell you once you got their service plan they could care less about you, I know because I  worked for them a while back. I think stories like this one are far too commonplace, the same thing happened to my sister a couple of years ago.  Hopefully best buy will learn, but I doubt they will.  I would check out Bestbuysux.org, they would understand your story a lot better and wouldn't have smoke blown up your rear by best buy employees who would never allow what happened to you and your girlfriend happen to you in thier store.

Dear 'Anonymous',
You love BB so much, yet you won't even leave your email. Nice. Anonymous Coward says it all. Listen, BB couldn't fix a laptop in three tries. THREE fucking tries in 8 weeks. You claim BB has no control over that? Bullshit. Incompetent service techs are incompetent service techs no matter how you slice it. That has nothing to do with not making the product. Don't sell a 'service plan' if you can't service the hardware.

yup, there is a no-lemon clause in the service plan. or perhaps you were just too lazy to read the contract on what you agreed to pay for and point it out to the tech or a manager?

No-lemon clause doesn't kick in until after the 3rd repair on the same problem. That's no excuse for them soldering a power jack on the mobo the FIRST repair, and the sound not working on the SECOND attempt. 

Read the whole thing. THe tech were unwilling or unable to do anything, and the managers and corperate support were of no help either before the THIRD repair.

Best Buy sucks and they could care less about you...  The only thing they really want is for you spend money like crazy on accessories and a service plan because of the profit.

If you purchase a service plan they find it ideal to never see you again, 100% profit in the pocket.  When you show up with a problem they BS and try to place the blame on the customer whenever possible.

I'm an exemployee from the tech service bench and I've seen it all.  

Don't dedicate yourself to this company, infact purchase something from them and buy no accessories... it hurts there numbers and gets them introuble internally.  ;)

Gosh...my husband and I are sooo furious right now.  We bought a plasma t.v. from best buy just 6 months ago.  About a month ago, the controls started acting abnormal.  The the control pop up menus would not come on the screen, (like the volume bar that goes up and down, the menu screen that controls color, contrast, etc., and input menu, like antenna, video 1, 2, etc..)  So we put in a service request, since we got sucked into purchasing their service plan, which from past experience SUCKS!!! (From our computer not getting repaired/switched out, a vcr which never functioned properly and never got fixed til it finally died, etc...)  Sure enough, best buy's incompetence strikes once again....this service technician who supposedly is "manufacturer trained" off the bat asks me for the Toshiba manual...what the hell!!  So I asked him, aren't you familiar w/ the t.v.?  He says, "no".   Man, were we at his mercy from that time on....what am I to do...  So he checks it out, and he can't even find the damned serial number...and asked me to help him find it...  So he leaves from this first appt. and says he'll be back w/ the part which he will be ordering.  He is to ask his supervisor what part he will be needing to repair the t.v.  So he returns today, and to make a long story short, our plasma t.v. is now DEAD!  He obsiously DID NOT know what he was doing, cuz he kept communicating through walkie talkie to someone who seemed to be walking him through the repair.  An hour later, there was black screen and the plasma would not power up anymore.  Infuriated, I called the 888bestbuy number, and they had this "I don't care" attitude, and that we are supposed to let him come back with a whole mother board to repair what he has damaged!  What is up with that!!!  He damaged it, it's only right that they replace it with a new one!!  How do I know how much damage he did to the back, and who in their right mind would let him touch their t.v. again!!!!  Any suggestions...we are soooo exhausted in fury at this point....we now are in worst shape than before the tech arrived.  We have nooo t.v., just a black screen.  He sealed up the t.v. and was sooo quick to get out of my house, and did not even leave me any paper work or proof he was here!!!

<h4>Updated!</h4>
<p>
I've tweaked the code below to also toggle the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Warning: the XSLT processor I use to serve this site currently mistakenly escapes the pipe and double-pipe (logical or) operator in the javascript code. Make sure to change these back before you try using the code below. Hopefully I can get the XSLT stuff upgraded this weekend.</strong>
</p>
</ins>
<p>
So I went to a <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2003a.html#t20030203">CSS presentation</a> given by <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a>
last night ad Tri-C West. Great presentation Eric! One thing he did a lot was switch between styled and unstyled pages, but he did this
in IE because IE has a preference for enabling/disabling stylesheets. Mozilla/Netscape doesn't appear to have one. :-(
</p>
<p>
So, after some tinkering, with the help of the <a href="http://www.xulplanet.com/downloads/prefbar/">Preferences Toolbar</a>, you can now have a "Toggle CSS" button.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Once you've <a href="http://www.xulplanet.com/downloads/prefbar/">installed the PrefBar</a>, click the "Customize" button on the right side of the PrefBar.</li>
<li>Click the "New Item" button.</li>
<li>In the New Item dialog box, under the Item Type dropdown menu, select "Button"</li>
<li>In the Id text box, type "toggleCSS"</li>
<li>In the Label text box, type "Toggle CSS"</li>
<li>In the onclick text box, enter the following javascript:
<textarea rows="5" cols="40">
var links = window.content.document.getElementsByTagName("link");var styles = window.content.document.getElementsByTagName("style");var regex_rel = /^stylesheet/i;var regex_media	= /^(all|screen)/i;for (var l=0;l&lt;links.length;l++) {var link = links[l];if (regex_rel.test(link.rel) &amp;&amp; (regex_media.test(link.media) || !link.media)) {link.disabled=!link.disabled;};};for (var s=0;s&lt;styles.length;s++) {var style = styles[s];style.disabled=!style.disabled;};
</textarea>

</li>
<li>Hit "OK" to close all remaind dialog boxes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Whala! You should now be able to toggle on/off the stylesheets in the link tags of each site.
</p>

<p>
A couple items to note. The code will only toggle link tags with rel="Stylsheet" and media="screen", media="all", or no media specified.
I use Mozilla, so I've not tried the PrefBar in Netscape, but it should work. (Famous Last Words).
</p>

<p>
Here is the tabulated code for the curious:
</p>
<p>
<textarea rows="15" cols="60">
var links = window.content.document.getElementsByTagName("link");
var styles = window.content.document.getElementsByTagName("style");
var regex_rel = /^stylesheet/i;
var regex_media	= /^(all|screen)/i;

for (var l=0;l&lt;links.length;l++) {
	var link = links[l];
	if (regex_rel.test(link.rel) &amp;&amp; (regex_media.test(link.media) || !link.media)) {
		alert(link.media);
		link.disabled=!link.disabled;
	};
};

for (var s=0;s&lt;styles.length;s++) {
	var style = styles[s];
	style.disabled=!style.disabled;
};</textarea>
</p>

I hope that should be against the law everywhere. By the way, when I was in Boston and Salem Mass. a couple of times between 1991-1995, it was illegal to get tattoos also. Go figure. I ended up getting mine in Toronto, Canada instead.

<p>
For the last year, I swore off <acronym title="Applicaiton Server Pages">ASP</acronym> (MicroShaft) and took up the LAMP (Linux/Apache/ModPerl) and swore I'd never look back. Never say never I guess.
</p>
<p>
Well, the time has finally arrived to try and make an informed educated unbiased decision about the future if the ecommerce site I maintain as part of my day job.
The site is currently built using ASP/<acronym title="Visual Basic">VB</acronym>/<acronym title="Microsoft Transaction Server">MTS</acronym>/<acronym title="Microsoft SQL Server">MSSQL</acronym>. So far, it's served us well if I do say so myself. 
However, the time has come to look towards the future and start planning for a major overhaul.
</p>
<p>
So with all fairness in mind, here are some of the design requirements that come to mind:
</p>

<h3>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</h3>
<p>
True separation of code, logic, and content. Allow the page creators to create pages without having to touch a line of code.
Allow the programmers to work on new functionality without touching the pages, or the look and feel. Allow the artists to develop new page layouts and styles 
without touching any code.
</p>

<h3>Flexible Output Mechanism</h3>
<p>
Ability to repurpose page into many forms (<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language - Version 4.x">HTML4</acronym>, Text, <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>, <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym>, <acronym title="Wireless Application Protocol">WAP</acronym>) without altering any page logic or module code.
</p>

<h3>WYSIWYG Friendly Design Workflow</h3>
<p>
The ability to edit the Model or View stages in non-text editors without them munging the format of the page.
</p>

<h3>Pre/Post Request Chain Processing</h3>
<p>
Ability to tap into the request chain to create custom pre and post page processors for custom url or session munging or custom output caching.
</p>



<p>
Personally, I would love to move to Unix/Apache/ModPerl/AxKit. But I also need to find the right tool for the right job. Even though it is old this article on <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/10/17/etoys.html">Building a Large-scale E-commerce Site with Apache and mod_perl</a> still intrigues me. The performance stats alone on that setup make my mind boggle compared to <acronym title="Internet Information Server">IIS</acronym>/<acronym title="Applicaiton Server Pages">ASP</acronym>.
Reverse Proxy Caching will almost certainly be part of a major redesign, but that still leaves the language/platform open to quandary. If both Apache/ModPerl/AxKit and IIS/ASP.NET can do the same things close to the same way, then it's going to come down to performance, price and development time.
</p>
<p>
Price is a no brainer. I'm willing to bet on performance, but proper side by side tests will tell the tail. As for development time, I could knock out an AxKit based site, <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>/<acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation">XSLT</acronym>/<acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation">Perl</acronym> and all pretty quickly. Dot 
NET is going to take some serious learning. Nothing impossible, but I'm definitely out of the loop.

Well, Best Buy called Yesterday day and guess what? <em>They're replacing the unit.</em> Finally. I guess the repair center finally gave up on repairing it which make me even more curious as to what was wrong with it after the first two repairs.
</p>
<p>
So, off we went to Best Buy last night. I was really tempted to tell them we wanted a refund and that we refused to do business with them. But I took the easy route and we got a new laptop. Actually, they gave us in-store credit for the purchase price of the original snd they also gave us pro-rated credit for the remainder of the service agreement.
</p>
<p>
Our local Best Buy has the following laptop brands: Sony, HP, Compaq, Matrix, and Toshiba. Well of course given those options we went with a new Toshiba Satellite 2435-S255 with the following specs:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel Pentium 4 Processor (2.40GHz)</li>
<li>40GB HDD (4200rpm)</li>
<li>15" XGA Display (1024 x 768)</li>
<li>512MB PC2100 DDR SDRAM (256MB x 2)</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition</li>
<li>DVD/CD-RW</li>
<li>3-USB (2.0) ports</li>
<li>iLINK (IEEE 1394) port</li>
<li>Infrared port</li>
<li>SD media slot</li>
<li>TV-Out port</li>
<li>10/100 Ethernet</li>
<li>V.92/56K modem</li>
</ul>

<p>
All in all, it looks like a great machine and it cost the same as what we paid for the old HP lappy, which was an 800Mhz, 128Mb Ram, 20Gb hard drive turd.
We did buy the 3 year extended service plan again. Hey, it worked if I have a new laptop didn't it? And of course, it still shouldn't have had to get that far.

Better be careful with the new Toshiba you bought. I have the same laptop (from bestbuy) and after a month the small plastic piece in one of the USB ports broke off. Bestbuy wouldn't replace it and Toshiba is being bitchy about the manufacturer warranty. They're trying to blame it one user error when all that was done with the port was plug in a USB mouse and unplug it. So be warned.

just so you know they should not and did not have to give you back the pro rated amount on the service plan so they did you a huge favor. it's supposed to be a refund minus any service provided including replacement so you actually should have owed them money, Glad you got taken care of...

Well, as much as I like my Sager NP5660, it just shed it's first casualty: the AC adapter. Actually, the adapter itself is fine, but the little metal part that plugs into the computer liberated itself from it's plastic/rubber sheathing.
I have a suspicion that the cord got tugged sometime and I don't remember or someone else did it and didn't fess up. It's actually stranger. The metal fitting sits glued inside the sheathing and it has little metal spikes that sit in holes inside the cord. Nothing is hard wired.
</p>
<p>
So, if they are built this way so the cord breaks before the jack on the motherboard does, then kudos to them. I'll take buying a new AC adapter over a broken mobo any day. I've ordered another AC cord, and when I have that in had, I may take a stab at rewiring the broken one. That should be pretty straight forward.

Awesome review on the Sager.

I'm looking at buying one myself soon (I finally sold my ancient Tecra 8100)...
The one thing that worries me is the battery life:
  - What kind of battery life do you get?
  - With one/two batteries?
  - What do you recommend?

Thanks,

I've had the same power plug problem recently; I own a ProStar 5654 (basically the same notebook), and as much as i like it there is one fundamental flaw in the case design: the heat vents. instead of scattering multiple exhausts around the case, they've placed one huge vent on the left side toward the back, right next to the power supply jack. if you tend to run graphic-intensive applications or games, the graphics card (sits right below the WASD keys) tends to heat up (hence the need for a huge exhaust right next to it) and the hot air is pushed out with the help of two powerful intake fans positioned underneath the case. of course, everything that is close to the vent will heat up also (the power plug, in this case). I think this is what caused the casing to come loose in the first place...

Hi,

     I have a Hypersonic Sonic Aviator GX6 laptop, which uses the same chassis as your Sagar from all apearances. My adapter was stolen yesterday (thank God I had the laptop with me, and it is safe) and I need a replacement. Where did you get your replacement? If it was direct from the company, can you give me a number I can call? Hypersonic gave me the number, 5600P-P, but they want $129, and I was hoping to find a place that could sell it to me more directly (not having to ship from the states) and charge me less. Thank you,
         Theosebes

Well another Valentine's Day come and gone. We got a room at a Radisson in Cleveland, the same one we stayed at on Christmas when we got snowed in. Dinner ws awesome. Four course meal for two:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Kick ass salad</li>
<li>Ravioli in cream tomotato sause</li>
<li>Filet Mignot, corn, onion rings</li>
<li>Cheesecake</li>
</ol>

<p>
The beef was awesome. Almost didn't need a knife. The ravioli was awesome too. All in all a good night. The next day we decided to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Science Center while we were in Cleveland.
It was coooooold on the lake. Damn cold. 0 degree wind chill. Ouch. But another good day just hanging out. It's so nice to be with someone where you just get along without trying. There's a novel idea. :-P

I've been looking for a new mouse to use on the laptop. Having that damn mouse cord dangling around is a pain in the ass and all the 'notebook' mice are pathetic compared to normal mice.
To make matters worse, ever cordless mouse that I've seen still has a 6' long dongle which on a laptop makes wireless even more pointless. Enter the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouse/wiebt_info.asp">Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer for Bluetooth</a>
</p>
<p>
Now I'm not really interested in the Bluetooth part. I'm sure there's something cool about it. What sold me on this cordless mouse was the notebook adapter included in the kit. Finally, someone who makes a small (well, smaller than a long corded wireless antenna) wireless dongle for notebook usage.

While I'm at it...all I'm hearing lately are these local/state officials playing the we-need-to-raise-taxes march to which I say <strong>Suck It</strong>. The excuses are usually something to do with schools needing money. I really do believe the schools <em>are</em> falling apart and they <em>do</em> need money. But raising income or sales taxes isn't the answer. It never has been the answer because the money just gets misappropriated. What they really need is accountability. Hey, isn't that why we have a legalized state lotto? "If we have a lotto, the money can go to the schools". Yeah right.  
</p>
<p>
What they really need to do is start a gambling boat casino on Lake Erie. That would rake in the bucks I bet. What really pisses me off is cities like Cleveland who pay their teachers a shit wage, build a new football stadium, then cry about taxes and levies when school roofs fall in. Hey, if your children's education is important enough to raise taxes, then it should've come first before the new stadium you didn't need.

Sit back, and listen to my tale of why every large ISP who newly impliments the
"Powered By Google" search on their site doesn't bother to test any of it.
</p>
<p>
A long time ago at the day job, I decided to install a simple 404 page on the
servers that would email me every time an internet user requested a resource
that doesn't exist. Like all things Murphy, sometimes images of pages are
forgotten during a rollout. No biggie. Better to know something is missing than to not bother checking.
</p>
<p>
For the 3rd time in the last year however, I've started getting thousands of 404
error emails a day from users of a large ISP implimenting the "Powered By Google" search and
it's now time to vent. First it was Attbi.com, now it's AOL. You'd think these
people would notice that every search result link with a querystring in it
returns a 404 Not Found page. Guess not.

<p>"Hi. My name is Chris, and I'm a standards purist."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So today, I finally realized that I've crossed over into the web standards purist camp (aka Standards Nazi) with full force.
</p>
<p>
How do I know?  Well, our new Web Project Leader and myself were chatting about the high number of IE browsers in our web stats, which led to the evil "m" word: "marketing" and their ideas of IE only web page hacks and silly user features for IE only.
</p>
<p>
I think I immediately started to foam at the mouth and ramble about accessibility, web standards, validation, usibility, etc, etc. So kudos to Mr. Meyer, Mr. Zeldman, Mr. Pilgrim and the like for stearing me toward sensible web markup.
</p>
<p>
Now don't get me wrong. I really like the new guy. He's very smart and knows how to organize a group like ours and prioritize. That is why we hired him after all. And I'm not even saying  he's wrong, or that we shouldn't be looking into IE specific page features if it means use and speed increases. All I'm saying is that usibility, standards, accessibility and the like should be priority #1. They are for me, and I hope they will be so at work.

I completely agree. But even if they do finally say they agree, the first time they can't figure out a way to do something using standards it will all go out the window in favor of browser specific hacks and bandwidth hogging (but really pretty) effects. 

Why can't the message being delivered be more important than how it is packaged. I am not saying sites shouldn't be attractive, just that on so many sites the actual content is lost in all the poor (but again, really pretty) design.

Apparently, my back decided this morning that I was [as suspected] to fat and it had enough. I put one arm against the wall and went to lift my other leg up towards me to remove something stuck to the bottom of my foot when my back completely seized. I couldn't move for about 5 minutes. After that it was very slow going. I went to work anyways. I figured it was better to be miserable at work where I could get something done rather than sit at home.

Christopher,


Sorry to hear about your tragedy. I can't believe that you are under 30 and having back problems already?! It's a shame to see smart people get hurt due to simple neglect of the needs of their bodies.


I've been practicing and teaching yoga for over 12 years; it has saved me many of the problems I hear about from fellow developers. I hope this incident will encourage you to take up some form of exercise to reduce your chances of future problems!


Cheers!

From the most-useless-steps-to-prevent-terrorism department. Giving directions to my house used to be pretty easy: 4 lights, 4 streets, and turn right at the USPS drop off box. Well, they've managed to fuck that up for me.
While driving home one day from the other side of town, I noticed that the USPS drop off box was gone. I almost missed my street that's how used to seeing it I usually am. I didn't think much about it for a while.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday morning, I heard on the radio that many local residents were complaining that their drop off boxes were gone. The reason? I'm not even making this up. "These boxes could be used in terrorist activities, so we've removed the least used drop off boxes". What?
Now if the USPS wants to save a few pennies and remove a few boxes so drivers can save time. Fine. Tell me that. I'll understand. But removing them because they <em>could</em> be used to terrorist purposes is the most retarded excuse I've ever heard.
</p>
<p>
So, let me get this straight. Terrorists must prefer to use only the least popular boxes, but leave the most popular ones alone? Unfucking believable.

The postal service honestly doesn't give two hoots and a shit about its cutomers. How do I know this,I worked there for 2 years. If you make a complaint in person or via the 1-800 number you are marked. Belive me that your service will decline wether you know it or not. There are legal ways of disposing of mail without customers knowing it. It is referred to as killing mail, or endorsing mail. You can pretty much kill the mail if you dont like the way it looks. 
Don't take a rural carrier associate job either. They dont tell you that it will take up to 10 years of pure bullshit, and no benefits, before you might be able to apply for another position. I quit due to only getting one day a week of work. This doesn't cut it when you have a baby that has major medical problems. So Anyways I quit and have been given bad refernces from the P.O.. Well guess those asshole always have the last laugh.

Ok, what the fuck is wrong with these people? This kind of stupidity really chaps my ass. Apparently a lawyer in a New York mall was arrested for not removing his "Give Peace A Chance" T-shirt that he bought in the mall. I hope these idiots get fired. Sure, the mall is 'private' property, but still.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
According to the criminal complaint filed Monday, Stephen Downs was wearing a T-shirt bearing the words "Give Peace A Chance" that he had just purchased from a vendor inside the Crossgates Mall in Guilderland, New York, near Albany.
</p>
<p>
"I was in the food court with my son when I was confronted by two security guards and ordered to either take off the T-shirt or leave the mall," said Downs.
</p>
<p>
When Downs refused the security officers' orders, police from the town of Guilderland were called and he was arrested and taken away in handcuffs, charged with trespassing "in that he knowingly enter(ed) or remain(ed) unlawfully upon premises," the complaint read. 
</p>

I would buy SCO and run their asses into the ground <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1016-991464.html?tag=fd_top">for this bullshit</a>. It's going to be a fun one to watch, that's for sure.
Let us pray that MickeySoft doesn't buy them first.

<blockquote>
<p>
The suit, filed Thursday afternoon in the 3rd District Court of Salt Lake County in Utah, alleges misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, breach of contract and tortious interference with SCO's business, the Lindon, Utah-based company said. SCO also sent a letter Thursday demanding that if IBM doesn't meet various demands, SCO will revoke IBM's license to ship its version of Unix, called AIX, in 100 days.
</p>
<p>
"We are alleging they have contaminated their Linux work with inappropriate knowledge from Unix," said Chris Sontag, senior vice president of operating systems at SCO and head of the company's SCO source effort to make more money from its intellectual property. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, I know. I think SCO is within their <em>right</em> to defend their IP. However, they've been turning this Unix/Linux thing into a money/press game for a while now. Clearly a desperate last gasp for corporate life. Goodbye SCO, you <em>won't</em> be missed by many.

I'm surprised Microsoft isn't making more a fuss about it, considering that open source is finally something that they're publicly admitting scares them.

Ok, someone clue me in.  When gas prices keep climbing, all I hear is the same old BS from the oil companies, "higher prices to import, lower quantity, higher demand equals higher prices".
Then I also here this shit on the internet about which companies to buy gas from that <em>don't</em> import oil, aka, don't support terrorism. Guess what? Gas at their stations isn't any lower then from stations that <em>do</em> import. So what the fuck? Sounds like gouging to me.
</p>
<p>
Don't even get me started on these fuckers in the Department of Transportation that want to raise gas taxes to pay for roads. And guess who's still making money in their companies on all this shit? That's right, baby George and cousin Chaney. Next it'll be these pissants selling natural gas that will drive their prices through the roof.

<p>
That is all.

I work at best buy as well and would never sell anyone a service plan if I didn't feel like they needed it.  We don't work on commission so who cares.  Just stop complaining about your own stupidity when you shop in the stores or any store in the world.

Apparently this is bad hardware month. My parents old HP Pavilion started rebooting on it's own. The culprit: shitty OEM 100W power supply. I gutted it and put the inards into an Antec minitower case with a 350W power supply. Problem solved.
</p>
<p>
Then last week when Margeaux turned on my desktop machine (Also a Pavilion), the video was squirrely. The video card in that machine is..<em>was</em> a PNY GeForce Ti440. A pretty sweet gaming card until that day. Figuring that maybe the power supply was also going bad (which makes the power hungry Ti card go crazy), I went out and snagged another Antec case; the <a href="http://www.antec-inc.com/pro_details_enclosure.php?ProdID=91082" title="Antec Case Specs">PLUS1080AMG</a>. This one is a full tower soho file server case with 6 fans, loads of bays and a 440W power supply.
</p>
<p class="center">
<img src="/blog/images/hardware/plus1080amg.jpg" alt="Antec 1080 AMG Plus Performance SOHO Server Case" />
</p>
<p>
Well, wouldn't you know it. That didn't solve the video problem. So I called PNY and it's getting replaced under their lifetime replacement warranty. And now I have and awesome case for the next time I build a machine. I must say , with 6 fans, this case is <strong>really</strong> quiet. But then again, I also have 4 servers in a rack sitting beside me.
</p>
<p>
I went out tonight to snag a couple of CD -> sound card cables before I closed up the case. I was really temped to snag an ATI Radeo 9700 Pro.

Forgive me Father for I have sinned. I have taken up gaming with another who is not my own video card. I know I shouldn't, but I've had impure thoughts and just don't feel happy with my old GeForce Ti4400. I have also purchased from the forsaken garden of Best Buy after vowing I would not do so. The temptation of higher frame rates was just to great in this time of need. I was weak and vulnerable while my Ti4400 makes the pilgrimage back to it's creator for replacement under the great and holy warranty.</cite>

Well, apprently I needed a new game to go with the new video card. I saw that Splinter Cell was released for the PC so I picked it up.
I haven't installed it yet, but from reading the mini manual, it appears to have some cool moves. I never thought I'd like battle/covert ops type games, but Soldier of Fortune II seemed to change that for me.
</p>
<p>
The current list of PC games I play:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</li>
<li>The Thing</li>
<li>Soldier of Fortune II</li>
<li>Splinter Cell</li>
<li>Civilization III</li>
<li>Quake II</li>
<li>Quake (Capture The Flag)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, if I could just <em>finish</em> on of these games without cheating. :-)

Straight from the briing-clue-phone-its-for-you department. Apparently a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2469167">3rd person has died</a> after getting their Smallpox vaccine. This time, it was a soldier. And like the previous 2 nurses before him, he also had a heart attack.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 Department of Defense (news - web sites) official said on Friday that the 55-year-old National Guardsman had died in an unidentified U.S. military hospital on March 26, six days after receiving his smallpox vaccination.
</p>
<p>
Two female health care workers who were recently vaccinated against smallpox have died in the past week of heart attacks. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
 "We are categorizing this event at the moment as <strong>unlikely to be due to smallpox vaccination</strong>," Grabenstein said during a conference call with other smallpox vaccination experts and government immunization experts.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Umm,. hello? Is this thing on? Three people dead after getting their Smallpox vaccines; all from the same immediate cause. Now I know why Margeaux refused to get one at work (she's a nurse). 100% seems like a hell of a coincidence to me.

Just to add something to the fray..the CDC has officially STOPPED giving the vaccine to anyone who has a history of cardiovascular disease.  Huh, imagine that, changing their policy for something that is totally "unrelated."  Things that make you say, "whaaaaa????"

So here I am, surfin this morning and all of a sudden no connection. Look over at the server rack and all I see it one of the little Netgear FS108 10/100 switches with all of its lights flashing on and off rapidly. Luckily for me, I had a spare. It appears that I have toated yet another power supply dongle for these switches.
</p>
<p>
I've been through this before (I've got 3 of them). And my first guess is that the original ones that came with the units are junk. The replacement supply I bought last year looks different <strong>and still works</strong>. :-) To make matters more confusing, 2 of my FS108 switches use a 5V power supply and have dip switches, and the 3rd FS108 uses a 12V power supply and has no dip witches. Go figure.
</p>
<p>
I know, I know. I really should buy a rack mount switch., but they're expensive, and why should I pay for a 16-24 port switch when I only need about 6 ports? For that matter, I need two seperate switches for my setup anyways. Such is the technical life.
</p>
<p>
On the upshot, now I remember why I opted to never get the switches with the power supplies built in. :-)

Holy cow, I had no idea anyone else was dealing with this garbage.  I just had my 2nd FS108 5V power supply blow out.  My 3rd FS108 has the 12V power supply and it's still chugging along happily.

I have no desire to spend more than $5 on a replacement PS since you can get a new 8 port switch for $5-10 these days.  Since this thing is in my "server closet" (aka garage) I'm thinking of cutting the tip off the cable and tapping the 5 volts from my server's power supply...

For anyone paying attention, I snagged a <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000164/" title="Antec Case Purchase">new Antec case</a> a few weeks ago. My one complaint was that the case has a Firewire connector on the front with 6 individual pins on the other end to connect to a motherboard. Sounds good, except that that are hardly any mobos with onboard firewire, and most people probably have a PCI Firewire card with one internal 6 pin connector; making that case port useless. Or so I thought.
</p>
<p>
After searching the net with little results, I decided to send Antec a mini-nastygram, and yesterday I got a response. For ~$5 and shipping, Antec will send you a replacement cable that has a 6 pin male connector on the end (to connect to a PCI Firewire card internal port). So I ordered and it's on the way.  It sure would be nice if they'd put that part on their website. It sounds like it doesn't even have a real part number. I can only imagine how many people need this part. From the looks of the usenet postings, not many people know about it. Go figure.

So I'm driving home tonight, and I see and realize something that depresses me. It was an elderly gentleman with a little wheeled cart sitting on a bench. In this wheeled cart, he had US flags, pins, stickers, etc.
Obviously (at least in my eyes), the man was selling these things for money; further reasons for this are unknown.
</p>
<p>
What irks me is this: should I be walking down the street, I would probably have avoided this person. Why? Did he look dangerous? No. Threatening? No.  So what was it then?
Well, two things I think. 
</p>
<p>First, it just makes me uncomfortable. I think I also fear that somehow, if I pay more attention, I'm going to let this event inside, and maybe guilt/sorrow into me. I fear that. 
I'm afraid of feeling too much. Sometimes, I yearn to be emotionally detached, but it never works that way.
</p>
<p>
Second is the fear of being taken advantage of. Through the stereotypes forwarded by the media over and over, part of me just seems to think that the person is just greedy instead of actually needing the money. Crazy stuff that for sure.
Silly brain.

In response to Todd's post, I have just read a review on the np8886 which has the exact same TV tuner. They said it was more of a novelty than anything. Check here: <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.html?i=1775&amp;p=1I" rel="nofollow">http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.html?i=1775&amp;p=1I</a> was seriously considering that model because of the S-video INPUT. I am a gamer and would love to be able to plug my XBOX or PS2 into my laptop and have the best of both worlds. Console and PC gaming on the go. Mostly because I am sitting in IRAQ right now and it would be nice to have a laptop or console (or both) for entertainment. I deploy alot and am definately buying a laptop when I get home. Probably the 5670 though because the more I think about it I probably will only take the console or the laptop not both when I deploy. Its a great gaming laptop and a couple hundred $'s less than the 8886 and lighter too. It also had 128mb of video memory vs. 64mb on the 8886/7. So, inconclusion The 8886/7 has a poor TV tuner, less video memory, an MP3 player, which I will not use (already have one), a sony memory stick reader? I dont have any sony devices....You get the idea. Anyway sorry for the lenghty post. I get kind of ANALytical sometimes. Overall I think Sager makes great machines, it's just finding the one with the right features and price.   Hope this helps.

Hawash, a U.S. citizen, was arrested last month by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force.

Now <strong>you</strong> are a suspect because you (in the past) made a donation to a 'terrorist organization' (which was once just a normal charity in the minds of the government)?
</p>
<p>
I have just two words to say about that: <strong>Fuck You</strong>. I've nevervoted in the past, because I've never liked any of the candidates. But I will now start. We need to get these people out of office ASAP.

So I've heard people rave about the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a> before, but I never tried it for a few reasons. First, the site has no screenshots. I'm picky like that. I can usually tell right away but looking at a tool whether or not I'll like it. It has to be visually pleasing AND functional. On top of that, whenever I see the word Java in the descriptions and reviews of some new program, I tend to shy away. Java is ALWAYS slow IMHO.
</p>
<p>
Then yesterday on <a href="http://use.perl.org/articles/03/04/03/0723205.shtml?tid=9">use Perl;</a>, I saw a post about a new Perl language plugin for Eclipse. So I decided to give the whole Eclipse thing a try.
I'm very impressed. With Perl plugins as well ass XML/XSLT plugins and it's CVS plugin, this may be the IDE for me for a while.

Eclipse rocks! It's the best IDE ever!! The Perl module is very good, though far from perfect so far... But together with the basic Eclipse functionality it makes the best Perl IDE available. And 100x more useful and easier to handle than Emacs.

Just another day looking at or buying new hardware. This time they're non-computer related. First I had to stop by the local Home Despot for a new toilet seat and to take a look at backup sump pumps for the basement.
Then it was on to Advanced Auto parts for an inline fuse wire and a new battery for the truck. What fun.

Tomorrow our new furniture gets delivered. We snagged two tall bookshelves with a middle armour/entertainment center. Good stuff. We even went to Pier 1 to get some small fake plantage, lamps ans such for decoraiton.
That place is pure evil.

We also bought a Floor Mate and went on a cleaning spree. I still have to finish cleaning the office, and Sunday I have to build a new FreeBSD server for work. It's gonna be a long weekend me thinks.

Apparently while I've been tinkering with other things, LEC has <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/jediacademy/">announced a forthcoming sequel</a> to Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.

Let's hope they tweak up the performance a little bit to closer match other Q3 engine based games.

Speaking or preordering games, I really should get a copy of The Matrix preordered since I'm sure the abilitiy to find it in a store will not be to easy when it and the movie are released.

You know, just when I decide to research Visual Studio.NET, MickeySoft manages to piss me off, again, still, more.
</p>
<p>
So here I have one 60 day Trial Copy of VS.NET. I would like to spend some time tinkering with it, learning its quirks before I weigh in on whether I think it's appropriate for our development group.
So, after I get my hands on a DVD drive at work, I install it and proceed to tinker for about 20 minute. Since I live behind a computer at home, I also wanted to install the trial there and continue my tinkering.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>After</em></strong> waiting 40 fucking minutes to install 1.5GB worth of shit, then it decides that it won't activate because I've already nstalled it elsewhere.
That would be all well and good if I were using a retail copy, <strong>but it's a fucking trial version@#$%$#</strong>. The whole point of a "trial version" is to get me and as many others as possible to try it, then buy it. 
I can't do that when the piece of shit software activation stops me from doing so. To make matters worse, now I have to wait for it to deinstall itself.
</p>
<p>
Fuck you Bill. I will find another IDE.

While MS bashing is good fun, think about your complaints:

1) DVD.  Nearly everyone has a DVD-ROM.  Aside from that, the reason that they put it on a DVD ROM was so that they could ship 1 disc, not 5.  If they sent you 5 CD ROMs people would be bitching that they had to switch the CD 4 times, and saying stuff like "Bill you idiot, ever heard of a DVD??".

2) 1.5 GB.  Yea, it is too big, but a lot of what you are installing is the documentation, and extra tools.  You didn't HAVE to install this stuff, so how can you complain?  If you wanted 500 MB of documentation, you can't complain about having to wait while it installs that 500 MB right?

3) Their "trial" is probably different than what we think of as being a "trial".  If you wanted to save on buying VS.NET, you could just keep reinstalling the IDE every 50 days.  Maybe this argument is weak, I would have been pissed as hell too, just playing devils advocate.

Are there any other good IDEs for developing in .NET? (WebMatrix kinda sucks in comparsion).

So here it is, Sunday around noon and I decided to finally install the rear brake drum shoes and spring kit thats been sitting on my back seet since the end of winter.
</p>
<p>
Now I've never done rear brakes before. I did my first set of front brakes last summer. That's why they pay me to be a programmer, not a tech at work.
Mechanical tinkerings and such aren't my bag. That's why we have things like the Haynes manuals. follow the pictures. :-)
</p>
<p>
So I get the wheels and brake drums off, and tear off the old hardware, when I discover that the spring kit is a little odd.
The sprint kit is sold labeled as "full axle", which usually in installation speak means there is enough hardware to do both sides/wheels.
Yet there are 2 wheels, 4 shoes with 1 retention spring for each shoe.
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, the bag had only 2 retention springs and two spring seats, yet if had 4 spring caps and 4 spring bolts.? WTF?
So once I find someone to drive me to the local auto parts store, I bought a second kit. Same deal. 2 springs and 2 seats short.
</p>
<p>
Welcome to my world.

That's what they should call fangango.com. Cheesus H. Rice. This is possibly the worst site I've ever used to <strong>attempt</strong> to buy something online. It's not that their site layout or design is bad, it's just that the site doesn't fucking work. No way. No how.
</p>
<p>
Every other click, literally, yields me a "session timeout" or a "an error has ocurred" message. What a turd of a site.
Session timeout? Don't think so. just logged in. Cookies are on. No proxy involved. Javascript is on.
</p>
<p>
Let me just clarify. I work in the biz. I've built my share of shit code and had problems. But something as large as Fandango should be doing a lot better.
</p>
<p>
My bet: Their ASP is shitting upon itself on a busy Friday night. Time to upgrade to .NET. I here that 1 degree of seperation will solve their problems. That, or they forgot to sprinkle on the magic server pixie dust.

Well, I just spent about 3 days or so tinkering with C# and I must admit that I liked it.
I didn't realize how much I missed doing interface based programming. So far, I'd have to put C# as my second favorite language; Perl still being the first. One of the things I <em>don't</em> like about .NET/C# is that inheritance/overloading etc feels way to complicated compared to Perl's dwimish nature of OOP.

For anyone in the Cleveland, Ohio area tonight, you're probably watching the news stations ramble about an armed gunman in the Peter B. Lewis building at Case Western Reserve shooting people and holding others hostage.
During the news, the police chief came out and pouted and complained that the news stations were filing the SWAT team getting ready, and pointing the cameras towards the building, and showing the tank and SWAT heading towards the building. He didn't want jeopardize their safety and asked the TV stations to stop. Fooey.
</p>
<p>
Now I understand the argument, but that's what the press does. They've always reported every little nugget of info from behind the police lines. As long as they're behind the police lines, then I say film it all. Which brings me to my thoughts tonight: I can't wait until the relationship between blogs and news site comes to television and news stations. I long for the day when everyone in the crowd is their own portable TV station that I can subscribe to, and see the <strong>real</strong> news by real people, unfettered of any political agenda or any do what I say hand of political correctness. None of this bureaucratic Pavlovs dog crap.
</p>
<p>
Of course when that happens, then we'll have to amend the DMCA so you can't film news within RIAA/MPAA licensed city clocks and locations.

Just for giggles tonight, I disabled the notify emails from postfix about policy violations (when an open relay and such gets denied by my server), deleted all previously block spammer ip addresses form the firewalls, and tweaked SpamAssassin.

Actually, it hasn't been any worse. All I was really doing was just not receiving the notifications from postfix about servers being denied.

The only system emails I've gotton so far are resource warnings; spammers trying to dictionary their way through @icantfocus.com to find valid users. I cut those off at 3 bad addresses.

The spam level has been the same.

I think it's time to stop buying books and such from Amazon.
</p>
<p>
First, I ordered the <strong>Designing With Web Standards</strong> book by Jeffrey Zeldman back on March 31st. The book started shipping on <del>Wednesday, May 14th</del> <ins>Thursday, May 15th [so I'm impatient :-)]</ins>, yet their product page still says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This item has not yet been released. You may order it now and we will ship it to you when it arrives.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Wha? Real nice. Not only hasn't their page been updated, but it hasn't shipped. :-(
Here's what I got from Amazon about the matter:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Concerning "Designing with Web Standards", I apologize for the lack 
of an estimated delivery date for this order in Your Account.  This 
appears to be due to a technical error.  Rest assured that we are 
processing your order.
</p>
<p>
I have asked our order specialists to investigate your order further.
We will contact you again via e-mail if we discover there is a
problem obtaining the item.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nice and non descript. Where's my book.
</p>
<p>
To make mattrers more fun, I also ordered <strong>Enter The Matrix</strong> back on April 15th. I ordered it then because the page said if I pre-ordered it now, I would have it when it is released. I paid for 1 day shipping.
Here it is, May 16th, a day after the game was available in every store on the planet. Same story. No game in the mail. This is what I got from Amazon:
</p>
<blockquote>

Amazon is gonna give me $11.98 off of my bill since the game is gonna be late. I think I'll snag a local copy and return the Amazon item instead. Better yet, I'll just not sign for it and let them eat the shipping.

<p>
I've go way to many small things to remember to do today. Pay my truck payment. Mail out Creative Audigy2 and Inspiron 6600 rebates. Stop by the body shop and take a look as some rust on my 7 month old paint job. Pick up papers from work. Pay the bills. Bla Bla Bla Bla.
</p>
<p>
Well, the truck payment is done. I'll be so happy when I make my last payment in November. That will be nice having that $ in my pocket for a change.
</p>
<p>
The rebates were mailed. They were both worth $30.00 each; a grand total of $60.00 for those reading. :-) So of course, I deemed it worth the $7.00 to send them certified mail so I don't hear and excuses in the future.
</p>
<p>
Now, for my paint job. Long story short. Last year, I paid ~$2500 for have my front fenders painted, my tailgate painted, my read fenders and bedrails repaired and paint, and the entire rocker panel area of both side of the truck repainted including adding an additional layer of rock guard.
While my Dodge is a 1998, it still have less than 35,000 mile on it. So paying for a strip and paint job is well worth it if I'll get another 5 years without rust.
</p>
<p>
So you can imagine my disappointment when I notices a rust bubble on the right side during the first real cleaning when winter stopped. I should also mention that most collision places repairs and paint doesn't include any sort of warranty of guarantee when it comes to rust. However, I made the call anyways. It's not like I can just let it get worse.
</p>
<p>
Much to my surprise, my previous salesman was very understanding and friendly. He and others agreed that while they don't guarantee rust repairs, they also didn't feel that grinding it to the metal, priming, painting, rock guarding should have any problems this early. As it stands now, I'm under the impression that they are going to repair it <em>without charge to me</em>. (Although, while they're working on that side, I may have them fix something else that I will pay for). <strong>That</strong> is what good customer service is supposed to be like. That act of sensibility will ensure that they receive my business in the future, and that I will steer friend toward them for repairs as well.

I called PNY this morning to fetch my lost RMA# to return my supposedly flakey Ti4400 GeForce4 card. (I have since purchased an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro)
Just for giggles, I reinstalled it. While I did get some junk lines during BIOS POST, the card worked. I installed updated drivers and it is now functioning fully. Same mobo. Same computer. Same everything.</p>

I must admit to a certain level of morbid fascination waiting for your next tale of warrantee/performance/customer service woe. I want to look away, but much like the guy on the other side of the highway, I must slow to watch. I can't help myself.

Seriously Chris, thank you for not only suffering your quota of difficulties, but apparently also mine. With the exception of my Cube's inability to properly eject disks, my technology and customer service woes are minimal.

<p>
In an apparent effort to <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000197/#comments">not dissapoint Damelon</a>, I am today in what I could best describe as SQL Server / Hardware hell. Sit back children, and I shall spew forth a tale of woe and misery on this otherwise crappier Tuesday.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Note: I am a jack of all trades, webmaster of none. I know a lot about a lot of things programming, server, and admin related, but I am no means a full time DBA.

EXTENDED BODY:
<p>
It all started simple enough. I wanted to import a 200MB text file into SQL, do some sanity checking on its contents, then put that data in another table. I had no more completed doing this on to similiar SQL2K servers when I moved forth to server #1 (aka, the bane of my existance). Upon runing the job to import the file, SQL Server spat upon me, and issued me error messages including this nugget of joy:
</p>

<p>
<samp>fcb::ZeroFile():  GetOverLappedResult()
Error: 1105, Severity: 17, State: 2
Could not allocate space for object 'TABLE_NAME' in database 'DB_NAME'
because the 'PRIMARY' filegroup is full.
</samp>
</p>

<p>
Oh dear. Now, taking this error at face value, the drive this database resides on has 53GB+ of free space. Even the database file itself has 600MB of free space inside of itself. :-( On top of that, every <kbd>DBCC CHECKDB</kbd> and <kbd>DBCC CHECKALLOC</kbd> I run comes up clean. And of course, <kbd>chkdsk</kbd> on all volumes during the reboot came up clear.
</p>
<p>
OK, I'll play your game. I open SQL Enterprise Manager, and right-click Properties of the afflicted server. Auto-grow is set to 10%. Not trusting that, I decide to manually increase the data file size for the <kbd>PRIMARY</kbd> filegroup. On I did so , and hit <strong>OK</strong>, the server was anything but.The file size increased in windows explorer, then immediately shrunk down to its original size <strong>minus</strong> and unused spacing. In english, that means the server had no room to write new rows. Errors everywhere. Grrrr. Of course, our newly found friend <samp>fcb::ZeroFile():  GetOverLappedResult()
</samp> has returned.
</p>
<p>
So, after moving all client to the old db server, I reboot this bastard machine. Once rebooted, and with <strong>no server load</strong>, it resisde the files the first time, without errors, and also ran the import job completely fine. <strong>#$%^@#%$</strong>. While I was adding flames to the fire, I also updated the raid controller firmware and drivers so I could rule that out. After some monitoring, I moved the clients back to this bastard SQl server.
</p>
<p>
Sure as shit, the import job now fails while the server is under load. Damnit. Now to make things easy, I'm now getting different errors:
</p>

<p><samp>
Time-out occurred while waiting for buffer latch type 3 for page (1:213424), database ID 5.
I/O error 2(The system cannot find the file specified.) detected during write at offset 0x0000004eeb0000 in file 'd:\MSSQL\Data\************.mdf'.
</samp></p>

<p>
Funny part is, the last error happens <strong>AFTER</strong> the server read, analyzed, and repaired the file it can't now seem to find. OK, now I have disk I/O issues AND a currupted database marked as <samp>SUSPECT</samp> in Enterprise Manager. Time to move clients back to the old SQL server and phone home to MickeySoft
</p>
<p>
I must say at this point, the MS support is one of the best supports I've ever used; even given the fct that I have to pay for it. After about two hours on the phone, we discovered that I couldn't even copy the file to another drive/controller. At least that time, the event log spit up some disk error messages. Support and myself decided to rebuild the file from scratch. No problem. The database itself is 1 of 3 nodes in merge replication, and it's not the master of the data in question.
</p>
<p>
Not wanting to leave well enough alone, I decided to shut off SQL, and run <kbd>chkdsk /F <em>/R</em></kbd>. The <samp>/R</samp> option is to recover bad sectors. Sure as shit, there was a bad sector smack dab in the middle of the data file. once checkdisk finished, I restarted SQL, the database recovered on we were on our mary way; again, still, more. Run the import job again. Runs fine. No errors. Move clients back to the new SQL server. Run import job. Job failes. Same errors. Database marked as suspect. More back sectors. Rinse, lather, repeat.
</p>
<p>
Well, at least now I have a pattern to follow and trouble shoot. Disk I/O shits itself under load. So, with that in mind, I copied all of the data drive to another controller/drive. Guess what? That's right, while copying those files to a seperate controller, <em>that</em> controller shit out a hard drive. Just to be clear. The raid5 volume on the controller with the volume that <strong>wasn't</strong> having problems blew out a hard drive. Now I had to find a spare, put that in the controller, and wait for it to resynce the raid5 volume. <strong>#$%^%$#</strong>
</p>
<p>Once that was done 50 minutes later, I totally removed the problemed logical drive within the raid controller config. As I sit here writing, I am still waiting on the recreated logical drive to syncronize in the hardware. After that, I still need to wait for the OS to low leve format the new volume. If that doesn't work, I will then participate in a killing spree at a location of my choosing using a weapon to be named at a later date.
</p>

<p>
Of course, all situations like these need peoms:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<cite>
Here I sit all broken hearted,<br />
tried to import, and barely started.<br />
I'll try again. It's not my fault<br />
All I see is fcb::ZeroFile():  GetOverLappedResult()

We were running into the infamous "timeout on buffer latch type 3" error and was caused by the autogrow in tempdb.  Apparently when SQL Server is getting hit pretty hard and tempdb is taking a timeout to auto-grow, SQL server shits its pants and times-out. This combined with the fact that tempdb shrinks down to its last set size after a restart, you'll hit this error pretty regularly after a SQL Server bounce.  (If tempdb auto-grow from a set 1GB to 10GB, after the restart tempdb will be 1GB again. - Just how gay is that?)

Anyway, we just manually set tempdb to a respectable level to resolve the problem.

Where to begin. This whole situation gets more crazy by the day. At the very least, these types of statements shows SCO's ignorance. Linux is not an operating system it's a kernel. Not to mention that Novell holds the patents on Unix, not SCO.
Maybe RMS can send them a letter to pursuade them to call it <em>GNU/Linux</em> instead. (If you get that reference, you're a geek. If not, you're safe) :-)

Went and saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0315327">Bruce Almighty</a> this evening after a rough few days of hardware troubleshooting at work. It was pretty funny. Not as much as I expected. The best scene was the one they showed on the previews where the reporter (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Carell,%20Steven">Steven Carell</a> from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0115147">The Daily Show</a>) just started spouting jibberish uncontrollably. I think one of the funniest quotes is after Bruce has had the worst day ever, and someone else gets the job he wanted. He goes nutso <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0183505">Me, Myself, and Irene</a>: Hank style, then says in his best news reporter voice: <cite>"Back to you, Fuckers"</cite>.

<p>
Yesterday <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000199/">wasn't such a great day hardware/server wise</a>. Today, St. Murphy turned around, reminded me I'm not a DBA, and then gave me the finger.
</p>

<p>
Day 2. The server still chucks up sector errors during disk load while importing a text file. This is after completely destroying and recreating that drive volume at the BIOS and OS levels. On a whim, another searched IBMs website wasn't found the following article: <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=psg1MIGR-50419"><strong>ServeRAID - RAID-5 potential for data loss with ServeRAID under stress</strong></a>. Great! That sounds like our problem. Update the firmware. Update the drivers. The errors persist. Damn.
</p>
<p>
So, off we go, calling both Microsoft <em>and</em> IBM. Neither had any useful information or suggestions. Keep in mind, at this point, no one at Microsoft asked very few questions about the hardware or disk setup, nor did they suggest running <kbd>chkdsk</kbd> using the <kbd>/R</kbd> option to check for bad sectors.
</p>

<p>
After some thinking, and grasping for straws, we tried an experiment (one of many). Boot into the BIOS and turn off Hypertheading for the two XEON procs. Reboot with 2 CPUs instead of 4. Put server under load. Run the import job. Whola! No more disk errors. Then someone pointed out; if the CPUs are bottlenecked, the disks never get a chance to be bottlenecked. No shit! Obvious, but simple.
</p>
<p>
So, with that in mind, we enabled Hyperthreading again, added a new 15,000RPM Ultra320 disk, and moved the tempdb to another disk. Put load on server. Run import job. Errors are still gone!
</p>

<p>
So, it appears that our problem is with the disk configuration we chose for this server. For that matter, we have 2 other servers that never displayed this problem (with more restrictive disk configurations than this new one), reinforcing that theory that their older (only 2 instead of 4) CPUs never became less of a bottleneck to raise and disk I/O problems. Like I said, I'm not a DBA, just a programming/server jockey. Live and learn. I guarantee that we'll never make that mistake again.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that disturbs me is no matter what type of disk I/O load we have, no decept controller/driver/sql should ever spit out sector errors and corrupt the database.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I've given Tim Bray his share of grief, but in this piece about the state of CSS, he nails it. <em>I esp like the bit about rocket science. Right on.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also from Tim's page
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So I determined to Do The Right Thing Dammit, and I have now invested several hours trying to figure out how to have nicely-resizeable fonts <em>and still have it look decent in at least the popular browsers</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Personally, I don't see what the big deal is with using the font size keywords in CSS. Hell, this site uses them just fine. Sure, some browsers display things in different font sizes than I would like. Sure, sometimes this means some browsers get smaller fonts than we would like by default. But so what. Deal with it. Cope. Accept it. The web is dynamic, not static. It's about displaying and <strong>reusing</strong> information. Even if that small definition of reuse is a print vs. screen stylesheet.
</p>
<p>
Repeat after me 1000 times: <cite>The web medium is not a print publication.</cite>
</p>
<p>
While I am no one compred to Tim, or even Dave, I think they (Dave esp., and anyone else using CSS) needs to just let go of the baggage of trying to hold a death grasp on how different browsers display different fonts and font size keywords, hell, even positioning to and extend ("but in xxx browser it's 2 pixels off") . I also think using pixel sizes and font tags, irrespective of if it is more consistant across browsers, is more of a disservice to your web users and web standards as a whole since it doesn't promote reusability of your content.

I have yet to ever design a website for another and not have them display this perception that the whole reason to do a website is to have an exact replica of a printed page without having to pay a printer to get it. In addition they want immutable placement of graphics and spectrum perfect colors.

Some <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=scoble&amp;comment=3134">interesting comments</a> on the <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Robert Scoble's</a> page regarding the previously mentioned <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/28/CSS-IE">Tim Bray article on MSIE and CSS issues and standards</a>.  Someone brought up ASP.NET server side controls, which prompted me to issue this rant.
</p>

<p>
ASP.NET server side controls are a fucking joke, from the standpoint of having W3C compliant HTML/XHTML web pages. Why a company who is on the W3C standards committees and was building a project like ASP.NET from scratch couldn't get their controls to output valid fucking HTML, let alone XHTML is beyond my fathom. Although, this same company can't seem to build a compliant web page on their site either so at least they're consistent.  Even if the XHTML specs weren't final, update the shit now that they are and give us something better.
</p>

<p>
This is even more maddening considering that server side controls in ASP.NET (along with the fact that ever page object is programmable without interspersed ASP code within the HTML) is the best idea to come out of .NET development. Things like the damn asp:form server side junk which outputs VIEWSTATE input elements even after you turn off all view state in the config is insane. So anyone who wants to move to ASP.NET and output W3C compliant pages (mainly XHTML) is forced into 3 shitty choices:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't use any server side controls. Yeah, lets have the programmers reinvent the wheel every page, and slow down development time instead of using postbacks.</li>
<li>Use server side controls and never have a page that validates.</li>
<li>Spend a retarded amount of time inheriting and overriding all server side controls using customized <samp>Render()</samp> methods to output the desired code.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Personally, #3 will be my option for another reason. I think server side controls that output HTML/XHTML is just a plain wrong idea from the start, esp. from the viewpoint of separation of content vs. look and feel.
To me, HTML4 is part of the look and view (View) of the site. What if you want text, or PDF, or XHTML? Then your screwed. All server side controls should output XML, and accept a pointer to a style sheet so you can transform it's output on the fly to whatever you need.  
</p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong. I love ASP.NET and C#, even after admitting that I'm a big Perl/Apache fan and usually hate the dark side. I'll never use .NET for freelance websites or projects so people don't have to buy SQL or W2K Server and licenses. But I'm not happy about having to jump through many hoops to be efficient using existing server side controls AND trying, begging, forcing ASP.NET to output compliant pages.

Yeah I have to agree, although I'm sure very different parts of the company are involved in these different respects, it's still _bad_ of Microsoft to not put valid XHTML/HTML into some company wide policy or whatever.

Indeed. Actually, that's the ironic part. With the VS6 of the past, it was definately an all or nothing proposition. You either excepted the garbage it tossed out and used ALL MS tools, or you used none of it.

With VS.NET, it's pretty flexible and plays nice with most non MS things.

If they would've only made those server controls cleaner and made a real effort to play the W3C HTML/XHTML/DOM standards game, I would sing it's praises as much as I could.

But alas, it's the same old routine. Good intentions in; Garbage out.

Just a quick note. I think I successfully made a comment on your "which Matrix character am I" post but it does not display. I don't remember this being the case in your previous build. Comments would immediately show, but TBs would only show that one had occurred, the actual TB information would wait until the next rebuild. Or am I misremembering?

Well, my son started a real bout of screaming right as I was sending that comment and so I suppose it's not inconceivable that I cancelled it accidently, thinking I had actually posted it. What can I say, I'm still new to this whole daddy thing.

I've been thinking about starting a new blog. In this blog, I would post simple small categorized snippets of things I learn and mistakes I make every day about SQL, C#, hardware, server problems, etc. Not a new idea by any means. I always thought it would be cool to have a place to search about a topic to see what things I've learned or corrected in the past. Call it deja vu, but I've had times in the past where I was stumped about a programming or hardware/server error only to realize later that I'd tackled the problem long ago and forgotten. Plus, other people I work with could also tap my mistakes and solutions when their having similiar issues.

When I started blogging, I went with an extra layer of categorization via two different blogs -- Left Half and Right Half.  Now, though, I regret it because a lot of times, an entry "belongs" on both resulting in me having to double post (redundancy == bad).  I wish I would have done one "true" blog, and then added some magic URL parsing so that if you went to "/left" you only received technically-oriented entries; similarly, if one went to "/right" they would get the others.

One of these days, I am going to actually get around to consolidating the blogs...

Both ways work -- two blogs versus one blog with heavy usage of multiple categories for each entry + URL-fu.  I guess is just depends on the end result.  TMTOWTDI.

While the details must remain slim, I have witnessed something that, as a Sys Admin,  angers me, and makes me cry with laughter at the same time. We've all probably seen emails from people who have a 12 mile paragraph of legal-mumbo-jumbo-confidental-private-such-and-such-law disclaimers at the end?
I hate those. It's stupid, unenforceable, a waste ob bandwidth, and just plain bad netiquete, esp when you're on things email lists that get archived.
</p>
<p>
Well, I know someone who's place of daily entertainment decided to append such a disclaimer to the end of every outgoing email, <em>at the advice of their legal council</em> of course. Needless to say. those types of disclaimers only serve to point out how paranoid or ignorant a place really is IMHO.
</p>
<p>
Well, sure enough, the irony kicks in. Weeks later, that <em>same</em> legal coucil sends a confidental email with attached confidential document to an incorrect email address that gets routed to a bunch of regular joes instead of the indended higher up recipient. To top that off, the aformentioned legal council <strong><em>had no legal confidental disclaimer</em></strong> at the bottom of their emails, as they tell other people to do. Forget the whole fact that if the email is so damn confidental, encrypt the fucking emails!
</p>
<p>
Fitting I think.

Are you really trying to imply lawyers should be sensible or display practical intelligence or *gasp* not abuse the resources of others?

The truth according to me is that lawyers don't actually want anything ever really, truly, secure. They want things actionable so they can litigate, but they don't actually want them secure. That's why big disclaimers are used, but actual security is not. If everything was actually secure they would have no one to potentially sue. Of course I'm an admitted pessimist so my opinion might not necessarily reflect the opinion of management.

Well, I was a very <em>very</em> bad boy today. I ordered the parts for my new game rig. This time, I decided to follow my own adivce. Buy what you want, top of the line even, so you won't regret not getting it later just for the sake of a few bucks here and there. My real goal is the best game box I can get for a reasonable amount of cash, and something that will run Doom III and Half-Life<sup>2</sup> without batting an eye with all of the fancy options turned on/up..

Lucky for me, I snagged the Audigy2 card and the Inspire 6600 speakers a last month, on the last day that they both had a $30 rebated. :-)
</p>
<p>
I've seen posts on net where people have has this rig overclocked to ~3.5-3.7Ghz, yielding 16,500+ on 3DMark01 and insane Frames Per Second (400+) in QuakeIII and UT2003.

<p>
The woman is going to become a computer widow for a while once I get this machine assembled. There will be a whole lot of Jedi Outcast, Splinter Cell, Enter the Matrix, and Soldier of Fortune II going on.

I present to thee: <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/credit/">The Credit Card Prank</a>.
</p>
<p>
Quite the example of a futile security effort. I always thought that signing your card was stupid. If someone stole your card, or created their own, the signature on their receipt and on the card will match likely anyways since they either created a new card, or just rubbed of te current sig.
</p>
<p>
I find this even more funny since <strong>a)</strong> my signature is pretty much jibberish (since I can't really write in cursive any more. I print everything and I'm a lefty), and <strong>b)</strong> when we asked my college prof to sign some school forms, he would ask us "What name should I use?". "Abe Lincoln!". Mr Lincoln and Mr. Einstein signed many of my college forms for me. :-)

</p>
<p>
All other security, browsing, and standards issues aside between IE and Mozilla based browsers, I find that as a web developer, I simply can't develop web pages using IE any more. It's to devoid of decent page information. In Mozilla-based browsers, a page info command yields me dates, time, size, forms, images, cache info, standards info, etc. With browser extensions, I can even see the full resquest/response headers, turn off stylesheets, turn off font tags, highlight tables and block elements, show form contents, and even convert form post's to get's. 
</p>
<p>
All of that makes my life as a web developer a whole lot easier than using IE. I would switch for those reasons alone, let alone less security issues, and more standards support.

Hi, i'am a .Net web developer with a MCAD certification.
First at all, the big difrences between IE and other browsers is that it supports every protocoll witch is available for javascript, vbscripts, old style codes, the new style codes(W3C), webforms, objects, applets and DOM refrences. The rest like ASP.NET/PHP and such kinda modules are part of the webserver. Plus microsoft also thinks about the people who don't understand all of this realy good and gives some reactions on code so that the programmer don't have to think verry difficult. Like when you give a window.location a parameter the site will directly refresh. This wasn't the real purpose because you need to give a location en write after that window.replace('url') and not reload because than your cache will not be read but refilled. It's a litle example on how microsoft wan;t to support everything so that you have a standard or you can call it a big pile of shit. But the most important thing is it works. And i can write a spyware program for mozzila, firefox or netscape with no problem, the only reason it doesn't happens is because of the amount of users.

So i don;t think that you can give IE a disrespect because it handles alot of rules in a time a otherbrowser would dream of.

It's pretty rare that I'm on the receiving end of good customer service. It seems that more and more we all get the shaft, and people forget how to treat a customer like a customer instead of a burden.
</p>
<p>
Last weekend we ordered 2 pizzas and an order of cheese sticks from the local Papa Johns for delivery. When the guy arrived, they were missing one pizza. He left the one pizza and cheese sticks, without getting paid, and headed back to Papa Johns.
</p>
<p>
About 20 minutes later, the driver returned. However, instead of our missing pizzia, he returned with and entirely new order: 2 additional pizzas and another order of cheese sticks which we paid for. The first pizza and cheese stick were free. Fantastic.

I moved to Myrtle Beach in April and I've been ordering Papa Johns Pizza.  I've had it delivered almost everytime, but today I called and they told me they don't deliver to my complex (River Landing) anymore.  I really enjoy the pizza but if I can't get it delivered I'll go to Pizza Hut cause they will.

I ordered the Chicken Alfredo Pizza and when it arrived there was not one tiny piece of chicken. I called the 1-800 and was assured someone would be contacting me.  That was 2 months ago.  I was fleeced out of $16.00 for a pizza that had not one tiny piece of chicken on it.

I recently ordered a pizza from the Papa Johns on South Cobb Dr. in Smryna, Georgia.  And the manager Matthew was so rude to me. Me and my co-workers had ordered a pizza earlier that week and the man over the phone told me it would be 45 min. but it took almost an hour and a half and when it came it was cold and there wasn't any garlic sauce and the peppers where all dried up so they told me my next pizza would be on the house but the next week when I called Matt said I was lying and that they did not have my information in computer.  But that's okay cause I am now a loyal customer at Pizza Hut which I order from every week.

Today, monday night, I called the Papa Johns on Greenback Ln and asked for the specials for a large 2 topping pizza and was quoted 14.52 delivered. When I received the pizza it came with a flyer that said I could have had a Monday Night Football Special for a 2 topping pizza plus a 2 liter of soda for 11.97. When I called to complain, the manager told me he couldn't quote me all the specials. I simlpy responded that he didn't quote me the least expensive special. He continued to argue with me and I hung up. I was so angry that I couldn't finish my pizza. I will never call Pappa Johns again!

went to Papa Johns at *6th and Ditch Rd. to get a Pizza, as I left behind the store was the Manager[whos picture is on the wall] and two drivers drinking Beer. P8ulled a little way off and watched[ each had a second beer] but had to get home before my pizza got cold. These are drivers going into the neighborhood where my grandchildren play.Sooner or later they will get pulled over for DWI and get in the Indianapolis Star. According to the store hours there was still 2 and a half hours to go before they closed. Dont want anyone to loose ther job over this but are these drivers subject to periodic drug/alachol tests? Want to stay annomyous because I still want to get my Pizza there ,they do a great job.

Papa John's in Bridgeport Ohio has friendly service.  Their delivery has been aa little slow recently, but  it's worth the wait!!  The oonly way for it to get better is for them to hire more drivers.  Other than that, Great Pizza!!

Papa Johns kicks all sorts of ass.  If you are upset about your service, tuff go to an inferior pizza establishment.  It's hilarious to read what you fools write in here, "I got a cold pizza" They aren't going to go out of business.  Papa Johns rules.

Call to order pizza at the Herbron & Josey location in Carrollton, Tx and was informed that Papa John's no longer delivers pizza to my area of Carrollton, Tx.  If they don't service the area why do we continue to receive ads to call and purchase pizzas.  Little Ceasars, Pizza Hut, Pizza Inn and all the locals do a better job that Papa John's and their pizza is better.  don't try to order on line they still won't deiver south of Frankford Lane. they miss over half of Carrollton.  I never knew of a company that had more business than they needed.

I have always enjoyed Papa Johns pizza,and have been dedicated to no other,but I guess all good things (so I thought) must come to an end.On January 25,2004 I placed a call to Papa Johns and was placed on hold for 15 minutes,only to be hung up on.Being a loyal customer I called back only to be hung up on again.Now I am a patient person,but this would be enough to make any customer rethink their dinner plans.So after much consideration I have decided that Papa Johns will nolonger be on my call list for my sons after game parties,karate get togethers,superbowl,and since I am a supervisor at a large warehouse(Zappos.com in case you were wondering)and have ALWAYS called you guys to help me feed my guys,you have lost a great contributor to your franchise dollar. My company ,like yours provides a service to millons of people all over America, and I nor anyone on my staff would ever treat a customer the way your Shepherdsville store has treated me. If you relay this message to your store manager in Shepherdsville (Troy) please let him know that some classes on customer relations should be a MUST do for the new year.

I am not near as nice as my wife so here it is with no sugar,if you can handle it.Your manager at the Shepherdsville store is a little Pr**ck.My wife called on Sunday Jan.25,only to be put on hold for 15 min.,I was then hung up on! I have 17 years experience as a manager, and I can tell you that people like your manager Troy give buissness a bad name. Now you may not care ,but me and my wife run large companys,that often have the need for a service that you(up until 20 min. ago)provided.I'm sure Papa would want to bust somebodys ass for the way his patrons are being treated.Putting everything else aside,one customer is too many to lose.I sure hope when I am able to start my own company I make enogh profit that I can hire little as**oles like your Troy in Shepherdsville to run off all my loyal customers.Just so you know I've taken the liberty of disclosing the amount of money you will lose in the next 6 months being as that is how much me, my family,and our companies have spent in the last 6 months(2,265.43).Once loyal,now looking.

Yesterday, we picked up our grand kids for the special long awaited weekend. Our income is lower now and we have to be careful. My wife saved a coupon from Papa Johns in order to get their favorite pizza that we usually do when we get to keep them. It is 2 mdeium pizzas with any topping for $13.99. When we picked them up they were $20.31. I was told by the smart talking girl. I asked for the manager as I could not afford the increase. He said the coupon which came in our paper was no good as he was not a corporate store and he did not HAVE to honor them. I told him I was going to try to contact the company and he said he did not care. I had to pay the price as the kids were expecting them. You have very good pizzas but ill trained employees. The paper in our small town should have said the Mooresville NC store does not accept these coupons. It would have saved us a lot of money and time. We are very disappointed in your company.
Thanks, Don Goodman

The students next door to me ordered pizza from Papa John's. When it was delivered to them, the delivery boy, parked in my 'HANDICAPPED' parking space.  I phoned the local store and very nicely asked the manager to explain/ask deliverly people to refrain from using HANDICAPPED' spaces for pizza deliveries.  He told me "he didn't think deliverly persons using handicapped spaces was 'that big of a deal'and besides they were only using the space for 'a few minutes', so I should get over it".  
Not only does their product bite arse in my opinion, the management is rude and discourtious.  I will never do business with them again because of the lousy pizza, and now I suggest they are "BOYCOTTED" because of their attitude.  Handicapped people just like the temporarily abled, also eat!

<p>Ive delivered pizzas for more than 6 yrs,first at Pizza Hut<br />
and now at Papa Johns and I have heard the same complaints over and over again,but I'd like to tell you what it's like from our point of view and maybe you will<br />
be as understanding of us, as we try very hard to be with you<br />
Complaints about being put on hold for too long:you might want to consider the fact that there are only so many lines and so many people to answer them and if you call during the dinner rush then you will have to wait til we finish taking the order of the ones who called first<br />
Of course ,it would go faster if they KNEW what they wanted to order beforehand,but that would be unreasonable, I suppose, since customers have to have the specials read over to them several times ,then they have to shout to the others in the background"What do you want on it"?(in our ear I might add) they come ba ck with can we get half this and half that--Yes Sir/Ma'am. Well, we want thus and so. so we type it all up and just when we think they are done, they change the whole order (even worse is when they call back 10-15 min later and change it all again--after it has been made and put in the oven,sometimes they change their minds after we have left the store with it) So,the reason you have to wait so long is because we have to take so much time with the first callers.You all seem to know exactly how long you are on hold,well then, how about seeing just how much time we have to spend on you when we take your order and you can't make up your mind.Oh and another thing---IT would be NICE if you KNEW where you lived!!I can't tell you how much time I waste trying to find someone who can't give directions to their own home, or don't tell us they have moved,not to mention those who have no number visible from the road at night,and could you PLEASE cut on some lights so we know someone is home?Our job is dangerous enough(we're ranked just behind  police and firemen on the list of most dangerous jobs)without having to walk up to houses with no lights on and the possibility we may be assaulted and robbed<br />
Complaints about how long your delivery takes:<br />
This is a 1st come 1st served business and if the customers before you take alot of time then yours will be later as a result.Answer the door(DON'T scream "Who the f*** is it?"--you called us!!) when we get there don't make us ring and knock repeatedly before you answer because you're busy on the phone or whatever and PLEASE have the common courtesy to set the phone down while we are conducting business,you're going to need both hands to take the pizza/wings/sodas and exchange money.And if you simply MUST run to the store/take shower,etc leave the money to pay with someone that is available<br />
If you find it necessary to send your children to the door,make sure they are big enough to carry the HOT pizzas with out mishap,and if you want to tip,tell them how much<br />
(some of you out there might want to know that the tips you set aside for us are going into your teens pockets,one girl even tried to get the tip money that was included on a check from me)Speaking of checks,please have your checkbook AND IDentification ready,don't have us stand there waiting while you run about your house and out to your car looking for it. WE ARE going to check your id--just like any other place you shop, so don't leave a check with your child or the babysitter,etc The same goes for Credit/Debit cards.YOU have to be there to show ID to prove you are who you say you are,for your own safety as well as for our own----if your checks or credit card were stolen, you'd expect us to catch that by checking ID,so don't yell and curse at us for asking for it.(and please return the pen I loaned you to write your check because you couldn't find one in your own house)<br />
The faster I can finish our transaction,the faster I can deliver the next order.Remember that the next time you wonder what took us so long and don't add to the problem.Time is money in this business and we try our best to make our deliveries as fast as possible in order to make a decent living,so don't "gum up the works"by <br />
taking more time than necessary to complete your order/delivery<br />
When we tell you your order will be delivered in 45min-1 hr,listen to ALL we say,don't call back in 30-45 min wanting to know where your pizza is,you're wasting the time needed to take orders/make pizzas,etc and its not going to get it there any faster by<br />
causing us to stop what we are doing to answer your irate phone call,plus you are tying up needed phone lines We KNOW you don't like to be on hold so think about the other customers you are causing to be kept on hold while we spend more  unecessary time on you<br />
Just so you know,Screaming,cursing and threatening us<br />
will not get your order there any faster either--   I admit we are not perfect,although we really do try our best, we do make mistakes,and if you have a LEGITIMATE complaint we will do all we can to rectify it,but there is no reason to call us every vulgarity you can think of,(you know we can't respond in kind so we make a good target when you have had a bad day,but would you like us to treat you that way at your workplace?)<br />
Don't accuse US of being rude when we are NOT,simply <br />
because you can't get your way and have free pizzas<br />
when its not late or made incorrectly.There are many scam artist out there and they use this as the excuse whenever they can't get their food free any other way.<br />
We could lose our jobs if this happens more than once,and unless you wish to be in court for slander,you might want to rethink your course of action--we do know your name and  where you live,so it would not be hard to have you charged with slander when you cost us our job(check with a lawyer if you don't believe me)<br />
I can also guarantee that I can bring in a roomful of people(customers included) to vouch for my character and my ability to control myself under verbal assault<br />
(I have been in the customer service business for over<br />
30 yrs and believe me I've seen it all)<br />
Treat us the way you want to be treated and we will do the same to you,and remember that you get more flies with sugar than you will with vinegar. And think about <br />
how you would feel if your son or daughter(most phone people are high school students) was the one being subjected to such vulgar,vicious,and threatening<br />
words.<br />
(One man recently threatened to bring his chainsaw up to our store because he couldn't get his food for free when there was no reason to do so)Some of these teens have burst into tears after being attacked verbally on the phone by an irate customer,some have quit their jobs because the abuse was overwhelming to them(How would you like for your child to be treated in this manner? I KNOW I wouldn't!!)<br />
By the way,we do a MILLION Dollars a year in sales at our store alone so threatening to take your business elsewhere just makes us laugh,especially since we KNOW you  WILL be calling back when you decide you want pizza for dinner and you don't want to leave your <br />
house to get. There are only so many places that provide that service,for FREE I might add.(I'm NOT going get on the subject of people who "STIFF" us on tips when their order is FAST,HOT,PREPARED CORRECTLY  and delivered during snow/ice/rain storms,flooding or heatwaves despite the traffic/construction work/roadclosures/bridge outages or parades that we have to deal with in order to deliver your food.Don't insult us by telling us we shouldn't be out in such nasty weather and to drive carefully--you called us or we wouldn't be there) <br />
--NOW, tip & tip well--we deserve it for all we do  <br />
to cater to your needs,take your abuse,save you time and aggravating traffic conditions, GAS usage and having to prepare your own food<br />
Having vented my own anger now I would like to express my deepest thanks to those customers who treat us with respect and courtesy at all times(even if we have flubbed up) who greet us with a smile to match our own and appreciate all the hard work we do to provide them with the freshest,fastest,best made food we possibly can-----YOU are the customers who keep us coming back to work each day<br />
THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART..........if there were only more like you......:))</p>

For the one reader of mine who may remember...a long while ago I made a list of <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000019/">Things I'll Never Own</a>. Well, looks like I have to cross one thing off of that list: Table Saw.
</p>
<p>
We started to remodel the kitchen. Just the simple things. Tear off the wallpaper, remove the waynescoating, spackle the large holes, texture paint, final coat, new floor, and new baseboard moulding.
Well, that last one bit me in the butt. I need to rip 2, yes 2 whole pieces of moulding. So it was time to buy a small table saw. Oh well.

This may be nothing, but it may be something. I've noticed a strange pattern I think. Lately, when I post a new item to my blog, I get a new spam in my Hotmail inbox. I wonder if there are some wiseacre spammers out there scanning RSS feeds and sending email when the post is probably online. I know I'm more likely to check new emails when I've just posted something.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if no one is doing that, and it's just chance, then damn me for even thinking of the idea for them.

For something based on 1's and 0's, computers really suck serious monkey nut sometimes.
</p>
<p>
So I put together my new game machine, and everything appears to work fine. Boots on the first try w/o error after assembly. Memtest86 runs overnight without issue. 3DMark01/03 run looped without issue. XP Pro install goes fine.
All in all, and easy time.
</p>
<p>
But at some point, the mouse starts going herky jerky (yes, that's a technical term) on me. I searched Google, and found everything from IRQ conflicts, to drivers; bad MS Hotfixes to AGP port speed; disk contention to CPU issues. You name it. I tried it. 
I even tried 3 different mice. Nothing helped.
</p>
<p>
Then the light bulb went on. Mouse X/Y movement jittered, but the buttons, scroll wheel, and the keyboard all worked fine. Hmmm. Then I remembered that all 3 of the mice I tried were some sort of optical mice. So I dug up an old crusty ball mouse (he he, he said ball) and sure as shit...it worked!
</p>
<p>
Now, that solution by itself would make sense to me if it weren't work the fact that I have been using that very [problemed] optical mouse on my old computer, on the same OS, using the same drivers, <strong>on the same desk surface</strong> without any issues. WTF? I then plugged the problem mouse back in. The jitters reappeared. I put a sheet of white paper underneath and the jitters went away? <em>Again, What The Hell?</em>
</p>
<p>
Why these optical mice worked on my old system on this desk surface, yet those same mice jittered on my new computer on the same desk is a mystery to me beyond fathom.

No wonder Worldcom/MCI had money problems, <strong>because their fucking billing system doesn't work!</strong>
That's right, they can't bill or do math do save their life. Sit back, and I shall share a story of billing lunacy.
</p>
<p>
A long itme ago, in a land far far away, I was responsible for some servers on a Worldcom Dial Office ISDN line. This conneciton was a 'business' class account with half a C class of IP addresses and 24/7 uptme with <strong>no</strong>, I repeat <strong>no/none/zip/zilch/nada/zero</strong> hourly connect charges.
</p>
<p>
Lo and behold one month, a new bill arrives for <strong>$5000.00+</strong>!@#$# And get this, I was being charged for a months worth of hourly charges, which is wrong. To top that off, it was for <strong>3368.368 hours</strong> for <strong>30</strong> days of service. Now let's go over that again: 24 hours x ~30 days somehow equals 3368.368 hours. Sure it does, on their planet. Our normal bill for the first 7 months or so was ~$126.00 including tax hoopla.
</p>
<p>
So, I call in to billing and customer service. After 2 days, no one knows what the hell is wrong. They claim they will issue a credit and to pay the normal bill. Next month, you guessed if, same shit. I call  in again. Everyone pleads ignorance, says thers nothing thay can do, and they again issue a credit for the mysterious hourly rates on an unlimited account and we pay the normal fee.
</p>
<p>
This shit went on for 6 months before we terminated our account with them. To this very day, we are still getting bills and phone calls about collection. Calling customer services and billing <em>still</em> yields pure ignorance and a blind eye to an obviously horribly stupid billing system. #$%$#@#

I feel you on this one.  I found this post while trying to find the phone# for MCI's bill department.  

I had MCI for log distance on my home phone for about a year.  When I moved my old roommate put the bill in his name 1 month before I moved.  We set it up so the last bill would still be in my name.  I received the last bill and paid it.  A mouth later I got another one for $13.  I thought I missed something and paid it sense the customer service reps where so positive that the bill was right.  I received a bill about a week later so I just assumed that it and the payment crossed in the mail.  The month after that I got another bill for the same phone (another $13 dollars and late charges).   I called my friend to see if he was getting billed by MCI too. He said that the he paid the last bill that was supposed to be sent to me sense it was only $13 and had been receiving (and paying) every month sense.  We called MCI and explained to them what was going on.  They cent me a check for $26 and said that it was all fixed.  
A year later I got a bill in the mail for $13. I called them and said that I was responsible for the charges (I haven't had MCI sense I moved).  I tried to tell the lady about the mix up that happened before and that MCI had sent me a check.  She said that I had to be lying because her computer should that no one and called about the account in two years.  She got an attitude so I asked to speak with her manager.  That got me put on hole for just under an hour, I timed it.  While I was on holed I noticed that the last 7 digits where the same as my old # the area code was wrong.  The manager talked right over me when she picked up.  When I got the chance to I tolled her that I never lived in a place with a 910 area code and I could prove it.  The manager said It's only $13 dollars, why don't I just pay it? I refused and tolled her that they would hear from a lawyer if it wasn't resolved that day.  I got put on holed again. They got every thing fixed after that; at least I thought they did.  It's been almost 2 years now and I just got a bill from a collocations agency for that same 910 #

So, we've been working on the kitchen for the last couple of weeks. Nothin to major. New flooring. New paint. New Trim/Moulding.
We know we wanted to eventually replace the sink, but didn't think now was the time.
</p>
<p>
Well, apparently St. Murphy didn't agree. :-) This morning, the garbage disposal broke and fell off of the sink.
So, we got to put in a new sink, faucet, and garbage disposal this evening. How entertaining.
</p>
<p>
Now that everything doesn't leak when we turn the water on, I'm going to bed. :-P

Hopefully tomorrow night I can tackle:

<li>why firewire drive stopped working in my new game rig, yet works in my lappy</li>
<li>why my front USB 2.0 ports on the case only work as 1.1 when they worked as 2.0 on my old computer</li>
<li>why it won't overclock past a 3.3 :-(</li>
<li>get the rest of the trim cut and stained</li>
<li>clean the office</li>
<li>reassemble my old computer</li>
<li>sleep</li>
<li>cure for cancer</li>
<li>meaning of life</li>

It annoys the hell out of me when I lose or misplace things. I could loose my ass if it wasn't attached. The office is a wreck, especially after building my new computer and also have the old computer parts lying around waiting to be assembled.

I <a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/archives/entries/000204/">mentioned this problem before</a> as have many others in the <a href="http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;PostID=34126">ASP.NET forums</a>. 
Even Mr. Zeldman has <a href="http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;PostID=34126">picked up the thread</a>.
<ins>The <a href="http://www.yayhooray.com/thread/25122.html">YaHooray thread</a> on the issue as well from Zeldman.</ins>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The frustrating part of this whole exercise is that .NET does generate some of the controls as seemingly compliant XML-ish code. But it's certainly not consistent and there is no obvious way of controlling any aspect of the tag or attribute formatting. This isn't exactly what I was hoping to hear, but I'm not giving up quite yet. If there's a way around these limitations and constraints, I'll find it.

<p>
I wrote Grant and email, and he <a href="http://www.splorp.com/blog/archive/2003_06_01_archive.html#105616763534105021">posted it</a> to his site. Someone <em>does</em> read my emails! :-)
</p>
<p>
For all the work that went into .NET, and ASP.NET, it's a shame that they took the shitty way out on this one.
Hell, considering the point of ASP.NET was to seperate code from presentation, why in the hell do they have code serve up HTML?

While I really like the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/">Firebird 0.6 browser</a>, there is one annoying thing that is keeping it from being my only browser: the apparent lack of SSL certificate options or management; forcing me to still load Mozilla on occasion..
</p>
<p>
When I installed my latest servers last year, I decided to protect things like IMAP, POP3, SquirrelMail and the MovableType admin pages with SSL using custom signed SSL certificates. In IE and Mozilla, this meant loading a client side certificate to gain access to those services. I haven't yet found a way to do that in Firebird, which means it can't access my MT and webmail pages. :-(

That's weird.  I have several web servers floating around CWRU that have self-signed certificates (I have an "all-SSL-all-of-the-time" policy with web application servers).  When I first visited them with Firebird, I was told that the certificate did not come from a trusted 3rd party; then, I was given the option to permanently install it.  I did, and I have not been bothered with certificate warnings since (from those servers).

I think there's a difference there. Self-signed server SSL certs are ok, but the interface to import self-sign ed client-side certificates was missing.

Actually Firebird does have a complete certificate manager, but it ain't obvious. Enter the following URL :

chrome://pippki/content/certManager.xul

I can't imagine why you couldn't figure it out :-)

For those of you keeping track, it's Xbox hackers: 3; MicroShaft: 0. :-)
</p>
<p>
Way back when, <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000021/">I commented on the humor</a> in the fact that MicroShit was trying to keep people from running what they wanted on their purchased Xbox. First, someone broek the encryption on the first round of Xboxen. Then MickeySoft used their deep pockets to shut down modchip makers and changed the encryption. Then someone brfoke that encryption too. Then came more legal threats and shutdowns. Now, the Xbox gets owned again, this time by their <a href="http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2003-July/010895.html">own buffer overflow</a>. I know, that's a shocker. "Trustworthy Computing" indeed.
</p>
<p>
Here's some <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/newstech/security/story/0,2000048600,20275965-1,00.htm">fud spewed forth from a M$ spokesperson</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"We do need to inform yourself and this... contact that Microsoft Xbox takes pirating of videogames very seriously," a Microsoft spokeswoman told ZDNet Australia by e-mail. "The protection of our intellectual properties and copyrights, and those of our partners, is a top priority and therefore we reserve the right to pursue and take action against anyone facilitating piracy of videogames".
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
OK, so what does this exploit have to do with piracy? Sure, it allows me to play copied games on my Xbox, but fuck, it's <em>my</em> Xbox. Shouldn't I be able to make backup copies of my discs and play them?
Shouldn't I be able to run non-game stuff on my hardware if I so choose? An exploit doesn't promote piracy, software piraters do.
</p>
<p>
Here's <a href="http://www.maxconsole.com/?topic=news&amp;sys=all&amp;article=230">the response</a> from the Free-X group. While they probably could have worded it better, I still say M$ can go pound salt.
MicroShafts whole attitude on what people do with their purchased Xboxen is while I'll never own one no matter how good they are. Then again, 3 of them in a cheap cluster running Linux is a good way to spite them.

<i>"Shouldn't I be able to make backup copies of my discs and play them?"</i><br /><br />I'm not 100% sure about what the law says in the US, but AFAIK, no, you can't. You can make backups of <i>data</i> not <i>programs</i>. It is illegal to make a copy of a program for personal use, while it is perfectly legal to do the same of a CD or DVD. Unless of course the US law deviates from the "standard".

What a loooong weekend so far. Friday we went down to my parents, ate dead cow and watched the fireworks. Stayed the night.  Got up the next morning. Watched Caeser on TNN. Came back home.
</p>
<p>
Last night we went to see the Cleveland Orchestra perform Carmina Burana at Blossom Music Center. Good stuff. I have bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003EUN/qid%3D1057506607/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/102-7997116-8303360">this CD of Carmina Burana performed by the Boston Symphany Orchestra</a> a couple of months ago and listened to it a lot at work. I just happened to hear about last nights performance on the radio Friday morning and snagged tickets that night.
</p>
<p>
All in all, it was a great performance. There were even fireworks afterwords. My only complaint (as a musician) was that some protions went a little too fast for my taste compared to the CD. Could be just personal preference, but sometimes, it's not about fast, it's about anticipation and build up...hell that's what music is about right?

<p>
Ok, repeat after me: <strong>the customer is not a criminal</strong>. Something small that pisses me off to no end: CD Copy Protection.
</p>
<p>
When I spend $40+ dollars for a game, I damn well should be able to make a backup of that game and stick it in safe place, or better yet, use the copy and leave the original alone. I'm so sick of being treated like a criminal after spending some hard earned green on some computer entertainment.
</p>
<p>
I try to be a responsible computer user. As such, having an offsite backup of important data is a given.
Everytime I purchase a new piece of software, it get's backed up and stuffed in my drawer at work all safe and sound from any mishaps at home. Yet these game companies seem to think I'm a criminal and put fscking copy protection on their CDs.
</p>
<p>
What mystifies me further is that some games like Splinter Cell have it, and other games like Jedi Knight II don't. Not only that, but it's ass easy get altered .EXE files that don't look for the CDs when starting the game. There are also a few programs out there that can zap these fuckored weak ass sectors and produce a working normal CD. So why do they bother? The hardcore pirates already use the more complicated methods to pirate their warez, and the only ones punished are Joe Six Pack Home User.
</p>

<p>
Back when I purchased Civ3 by Infrogrames/Firaxis, it couldn't be copied. I sent them a nastygram letting them know how unhappy I was that I couldn't even make a backup copy. Their response was pretty much to the effect that "You aren't allowed to make backups, read the EULA". Hey, fuck you. According to most legal cases here in the US, esp. ones about unbundling software and reselling the parts says it all: if it acts like a sale, then it's a sale, and what the customer does with it afterwords (shy of duplicating and selling copie) is fair use like reselling a book. My copy. Bite my ass. I shall crack all your CD protections to protect my investment and there isn't jack nut you can do about it.
</p>

Hell yeah!

you are darn right with all of what you said there. I live in Germany and the industry leaders just got politicians to pass a new Europe-wide law which (a) allows you to do a backup copy of a legally purchased object (CD, Software, Book etc.) containing intellectual capital and (b) on the other hand makes you a criminal as long as you have to bypass any copy protection in the process of doing such a copy! Now think about this! So why bother about buying a CD or a game anyway? Even if I do so, I am treated like a fuckin criminal. And guess what? I do not like that. Conclusion: I must be really eager to have it to even buy it. And another thing: if it has a copy protection -- I do not buy it, see where you fuckin' lobbyists will get your money from, when consumation is going down the drain.
Only flaw in me thinking/ doing this way: there are about 50 million german citizens following the herd like dumb cattle, buying any commercialised shit available. Talking about niveau....
I am interested how this is gonna end (figure me as an outlaw rebel for CD protection cracking with an AK living hidden in the woods....? Guess I should step back on drugs ;)) )
Regards,
Michael

Hello.

Yes there are things we can do about it. We have collected your DNS information and have made contacts with your ISP to see if they correspond.

We do not smile upon illegal backing-up of our software. Our "Customer Service" team is on their way to your house, and if they find any backups, they're going to burn the fucker down.

Haha. We win again.

<p>
As my two reader may already know, I graduated college with a B.A. in Music Education K-12, and a B.S. Music Performance: Percussion. At one point, I even had a real teaching certificate for the State of Ohio.
Given all of that, my first job was as a web programmer at an ad agency in Cleveland. Go figure. But every time I think about it, it makes sense (to me).
</p>
<p>
For me, they both hold some of the same qualities. I get to learn new things all the time. I get to memorize things like crazy. I get to create things from scratch. What really turned me on to programming was that it felt like a success from the standpoint that I, a musician, could program, and learn programming without going to all those stuffy college classes. :-)
</p>
<p>
Not to mention the fact that after 5.5 years of college @ 20-23 credit hours a semester, I really didn't want anything to do with teaching music.
Part of that is the fact that I don't think kids today can get the two things they need in school without it becoming a supreme court case: 1) their ass beat, and 2) hugs and understanding.
</p>
<p>
As time goes on, I realize that for my personality, programming is simply a better choice. In college, is was the type of musician that could memorize a piece of music in no time flat, but I was a great music reader [realtime], and improvising wasn't to hot for me. When it came to improvising I couldn't let go of the details. Everything had to work in my head, which is a great thing in programming.
</p>
<p>
I'm sure I'm not the only one. It seems to be that a lot of computer type people were/are musicians. Must be that right-brain/left-brain thing. Of course, I'm a lefty, and we're the only people in our right minds. :-)

When I first got Enter The Matrix for the PC, I htought it was a so so game. THe vid performance wasn't that hot, even on an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro card. Plus, the first few leves of driving the streets, and shooting your way though the opst office weren't nothing special.
</p>
<p>
I must say though, after playing it for a while on my new game PC (more faster RAM/CPU), once you get to the sewer levels and such, it's a pretty damn fun game; if for no other reason the slo-mo shooting, slo-mo jumping and focus-choking, which turns out of course to be a swift neck-break of your enemy including sound effects. :-)

I haven't made my mind up about inline images in the posts yet. On the one hand, I don't want to hard code them with my domain name. Hardcoding Bad.
Yet, it sure would be nice if they worked properly in RSS readers. Wonder if there is a &lt;base&gt; tag in the RSS spec somwhere?

<a href="http://www.justicefiles.org/">Justice Files</a> is a site dedicated to assembling and publishing <em>already publicly available</em> information on law enforcement officials, <em>including their criminal records</em> (think about that for a second) in the state of Washington on a county by county basis.
</p>
<p>
Apparently, the courts tried to shut him down, but were overturned since all the info is already public information. To you sir, I say bravo. I think it's only fair that the people in or working for the government feel the same loss of privacy that the rest of us feel; all for the name of national security of course. Could be terrorists posing as cops you know.
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
This is the court order that is restricting this site: Order of Judge Robert H. Alsdorf.  In Judge Alsdorf s statement ".....Defendants' site offers to remove this personal information .......... bear some resemblance to blackmail......" is interesting.  Alsdorf s' order to remove SSN's from this site is one of those orders that is the pot calling the kettle black.  <strong>Without the SSN's this site would not have been able to show the criminal records of Kirkland police officers, especially officers Keys extradition to LA County on a felony charge.  A FELON is not allowed to poses or be around a firearm.  Why is this guy a cop?</strong>

Well, this is going to really bug me. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla.org</a> redesigned the front page along with the new <a href="http://www.mozillafoundation.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a>. While I like it overall, they did something that really irks me after drinking the CSS/W3C/WaSP kool-aide: browser sniffing.
</p>
<p>
At first I did a view source, and it looks like good ole HTML4. Yet, when I validated, the W3C validator choked up errors (AFTER telling it what endocing it was; that's missing too) about missing <samp>type</samp> attributes in the <samp>style</samp> and <samp>script</samp> tags.
</p>
<p>
So, I whipped out IE6 (ouchie) and did a view source.  Sure enough, it's getting sniffed and sent non HTML4 compliant code. Come on. I expect a little better from the Mozilla camp on this one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>UPDATE:<br />I may have spoken too soon. :-)</strong> Looks like there are some strange cache/proxy/replication/new page issues afoot. Either way, nothing sending in patches won't cure.

More random acts of tinkering. I need some opinions on this one. On the 404 error page, I decided to add a search form pre-populated with the path of the requested but missing file. Currently, it strips off any trailing slashes and file extensions, splits each part of the path into a single word, then puts those words into the keywords field.
</p>
<p>
In English, that means that any searches for <samp>/new/stuff</samp>, <samp>/new/stuff.htm</samp>, <samp>/new/stuff/</samp>, etc. gets put into the keywords fields as <samp>new stuff</samp>.
</p>
<p>
Nothin fancy there really. My question is this. Do you think it's better to present people with a 404 page letting them know that something is missing and filling out a search form for them, or is it better to simply redirect the user to the search results automatically?
</p>
<p>
Some of that comes down to user expectations. Which is less confusing? Being told something isn't found, or asking for one page/url, and ending up at a search page for no particular reason?

If the 404 page clearly indicated that it was a "404: Page Not Found"; and then, had a clearly marked search field filled in the with the terms and a clearly marked "Search Result" area for those terms, that would least confusing and provide the searching functionality.

Well, I think I answered my own question. While aqutomatic search results would be cool, I think it could be somewhat dangerous, since all 404 request would hit MT and the search routine. I imagine this could be bad in a mini-DoS sort of way.

Lately I've been in the mood to do more CSS. I've tried HomeSite in the past, and even earlier versions of <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/">TopStyle</a>. I've never been a fan of WYSIWYG editors, even IDEs like Visual Studio/Interdev that try and second guess me. I'm a diehard Notepad/Textpad user. Give me a text editor or give me death, and leave my formatting alone!
</p>

<p>
On a whim I decided to try TopStyle Pro after I had tried <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/">FeedDemon</a>, a new RSS newsreader developed by the same BradSoft via Nick Bradbury.
</p>

<p>
After a day of tinkering, I bought a copy. Nick has a real gift and making highly usable GUI programs that Do What I Mean and get out of the way. That's a hard skill to come by, even for Microsoft sometimes.
</p>

<p>
What I like even more, is the non-greedy licensing. I buy 1 license for me to use this program anywhere I am; at home, at work; on the laptop, on the desktop.
That's how it should be. That makes me want to pay for software. This draconian per per user, per seat, per connection crap the BigCO's play is for the birds.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. The RIAA is getting out of hand.
Apparently MIT and Boston College are <a href="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/203/nation/BC_MIT_decline_to_name_students_in_music_use_case+.shtml">refusing some RIAA subpoenas</a>. Good for them. Now for the disturbing part. Read the next paragraph carefully:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In a subpoena addressed to MIT, the association is demanding the name, address, and phone number of a student who used the nickname ''crazyface''<strong><em> to download at least five songs</em></strong>, including Radiohead's ''Idioteque'' and Dave Matthews Band's ''Ants Marching.''
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now read that excerpt again. A student is going to be sued for <strong>downloading</strong> songs from Kazaa, not for sharing songs with others.  I would pay a heavy some of money to be there in the court if this student had proof of purchase of these songs/CDs before he/she downloaded them.
</p>
<p>
If I had bigger balz and time to spare, I would sit around Kazaa for weeks on end downloading nothing but MP3s of songs on CDs I already own. Fsck the RIAA.
</p>
<p>
Who's to say I don't own what  I'm downloading? Maybe my CD is borked and I need to download a track that is scratched? As always, the <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/22/2221223">Slashdot thread</a> is interesting.
</p>

<p>
Try this question on for size. I posted it to Slashdot.
</p>
<p>
What's the difference between:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I own a CD</li>
<li>I put the CD in my CD player</li>
<li>Someone else accesses that CD via Cat5 cable (assuming only 1 person at a time can dowload/listen)</li>
</ul>
<p>
and
</p>
<ul>
<li>I own a CD</li>
<li>I put the CD in my CD player</li>
<li>Someone else accesses that CD via 1/8" headphone cable</li>
</ul>
<p>
They're both sharing. Will the RIAA come hunt me down because everyone I work with can listen to my CDs using headphones? Will they also hunt down the person using the headphones?

"Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss."

<p>
Register.com is turning out to be just as bad as Network Solutions.
There's one domain name I have [mjmcpherson.com] that was paid in full for 3 years, AND on auto-renew.
Yet, one of Register.com's resellers keeps selling the domain name away from me.
The whois contact information is someone else, but the DNS information is still me.
</p>
<p>
The last time this happened, they clearly found my invoice where I was paid in full for years, yet couldn't explain the snafu. After a phone call it got corrected.
</p>
<p>
Now of course, it's gone missing again. More waste of my time on the phone tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
To make matters more fun, here's the dates in whois:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Created on............: Wed, Sep 20, 2000<br />
      Expires on............: Mon, Sep 20, 2004<br />
      Record last updated on: Wed, Sep 20, 2000<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's right. The record hasn't been changed since Sept 20, 2000. Yet it disappeared sometime this year again. #$%$#

I recommend directnic.com, I use them for all my domains and I've never had so much as a hitch with them. They're great in the way that you don't even know that they're responsible, because everything always just work. No, I don't work for them. ;-)

More on the Register.com fiasko. I talked to two humans this morning. One wasn't so helpful.  The other one however, did verify that my invoice on Sept 18, 2002 was paid, which means that the domain name is mine until Sept 18, 2003.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, he can't change anything. and now I must deal with the affiliate, which I think is bogus.
</p>

<p>
Here's my theory on what happened this year <em>and last year</em>:
</p>

<p>
Register.com's Safe Renew tried to hit my credit card 3 months too early. When it failed for whatever reason, instead of honoring my remaining 3 months (until Sept 18, 2003), they simply handed my domain name to the next person waiting in line. Needless to say, that's not going to cut it.
</p>

<h3>Update</h3>
<p>
Well, I contacted their partner PartnerEU. Their answer: "Contact the firm who it's registered with". Bah!@#$#</p>
<p>
I've since called Register.com again and told them to get a person on it. I paid for a year. I'm their customer. They need to fix it. Not me. Not the people who snagged it. Not PartnerEU.
</p>

Supposedly, she was giving all the information to an account manager to research and fix. She also mentioned something about transfer papers, to which I remined them that I have no relationship with the eronious domain holders, nor have I ever approved a transfer of any kind. I'll be real curious to find out if someone tried to pull a fast one by forging my authorization. This could be fun considering the people who snagged is is a law firm.

Yea I've had a similar problem. They moved over my domain name to a new account manager on a different website and changed my username and password. Yet now I don't have access to the email address listed as the adminstrative details of the domain name. So now I can't access my domain manager at all! I managed to get access to the email address listed on file for a month, and they sent the details there, but now since I am no longer hosting that domain I no longer have access to the email address. Thus, I remember my username/password but not the website in which I need to login to with my details.

Do you know what the new domain manager of register.com/partnereu might be?

Thanks!

Same thing here. For some reason, Register moved one of the 37 domains I hold with them to the so called new account manager. No use for that, no need for that. 

Problem is I can't register new domains with register.com now, because they say (watch this) that since one of my domains was transferred to another system. Let me quote the message:

"Please be aware that some or all of your domain names have been moved to a new system. As a result, you can no longer purchase additional products on this account at this Web site. You will receive new Account Manager login instructions from the company that sold you those names. Meanwhile, you can click here to manage your domain names right now."

Since I'm not familiar with this new system, and already have 37 domains together under register.com's administration system I don't want to go there.

They leave me with no choice but to register with another registrar that I feel comfortably with.

You think that's bad?  Here is the text of a message I sent to Register.com late last year.  Things may be better there now, I don't know.

"We are now into the 13th day of getting jerked around.  I again request access to the account I paid for.  I have made repeated requests by e-mail and by phone call.  The e-mails have been ignored, the phone calls have not been at all helpful and have been counterproductive. 

Let me reiterate & summarize.  I registered 4 domain names in bulk with register.com.  A single charge of $140 was made tomy credit card.  These were all renewals of accounts with register.com.  For some reason 3 of the registered domain names were transferred to an entity whose legal name and business structure is unknown. One of the 4 domain names was retained by register.com.  This transfer was made without notice or request.

My host server changed IP addresses for its accounts.  I had to change the IP addresses for each of the domain names with the registrar so that the domain name would again point to physical location of the web server.

I accomplished this in a few minutes in my account atregister.com without human intervention for the domain name not transferred to Global Partnereu (GPN).  I changed it in a few minutes with human assistance at Network Solutions after I ironed out a stale e-mail address problem.  In 2 weeks I still have been unable to get access to my account at register.com's cut rate no frills entity.  I would caution anyone to be careful and avoid the same problems I faced in trying to get a very simple problem solved.  I started this process 2 weeks ago and I am no further ahead today than I was back then.

One of the problems with the storefront entity, partnereu, is that it has little technical phone support.  There is a webpage where you can send an e-mail, and there is a phone number with a recorded message that states that there is no telephone technical support.  It is strictly e-mail support.

My first e-mail requested access to my newly created partnereu account.  I stated that the register. com password did not work.  It was answered in a few days and it suggested I get access to the stale e-mail account on file.  They could send a new password to that e-mail address.  I answered it immediately asking if I could use a quick method of getting access similar to that used at register.com and network solutions.  I stressed the urgency of getting the account up& running. This e-mail was ultimately answered 1 week later.

In the meantime I sent e-mails everyday telling them the urgency of getting my business back on-line.  It was very frustrating being ignored for a very simple problem and not being able to talk to a human.  In retrospect, the whole problem could have been solved by merely unlocking the account so that it reset to the default register.com password.  It was a 2 minute solution.

After several e-mails, I became frustrated and calledregister.com to have them help me out since they unilaterally transferred my account to their unresponsive no frills entity.  Register.com offered absolutely no help and gave me the impression that because I registered the domain names with their affiliate I was on my own to resolve it.

My e-mails to register.com had an auto-reply to contact the partnereu e-mail support group.  I reiterated my dilemma a few times by e-mail copying both register & its affiliate telling them they both had responsibility for getting me access to the account so I could get my business up again. The response was always auto-reply from register pointing me to partnereu and dead silence from partnereu.

After several days of no response from partnereu and no access by phone, I tried to pressure register.com telephone support staff to help.  I tried to convince them that I had originally registered with them after responding to their request for renewal of the domain names.  They told me that the renewals were not technically with register but were sent by Global Partner Network (GPN)/register.com

I told them that I originally registered the domain names onthe register.com website and had renewed annually with register.com  They told me that this time GPN sent the renewal e-mails and I had really renewed with them.  I told them that I had an e-mail receipt from register.com.  Despite my paid receipt from register.com with no reference on it to any other entity, I was advised that internally it was a transaction with GPN/partnereu.  They were unwilling to give any assistance.

Each time I tried to call register.com I was transferred to the partnereu voice mail line stating that there was no technical support.  Several times I said to the register.com support staff, "no don't transfer me to the voice mail again".  They would put me on hold for a few minutes and say,"Ok I am going to transfer you to a human this time.  I always got transferred to the voice mail brushoff.

One of the register.com support staff tried to convince that my real problem was with Logika.  They had technically acted as the registrar and they would be in the best position toresolve this.  Even though I knew that Logika did not have my account, I called them.  They told me that they were not involved in the least.  They acted as a front end in the process not interfacing with the consumer.  The support guy there told me to look at whois.com where it clearly stated that the registrar was register.com.

After I waited on hold at register.com support line several times over the next few days, I heard the advertisement suggesting callers easily transfer their existing domain names to register.com.  I had one of my few original ideas. I said to the support guy that I had 3-4 domain names in an account with another registrar.  I wanted to know if I could transfer one of them to register.com.  After an enthusiastic 'yes' I gave him the name of my transferred partnereu domain name.  I figured it was worth another $35 to get my businessup & running.  When i told him the domain name, he said it was already registered at register.com.  Despite it being at entity partnereu I could not transfer it back.  It was locked.

On one call to register.com I found a helpful lady who fetched a helpful GPN support guy instead of the usual transfer to limbo or expression of sympathy at my having registered with another registrar.  After verifying my identity the staff person emailed me a password & username to access the partnereu account.  The password did not work. The staff person declined to give me his name & phone number because he was temporarily helping the GPN staff & probably couldn't be reached again.  

I sent an immediate e-mail and called partnereu billing inquiry line.  I told them I had just spoken to a person who sent me a bad password.  I asked to speak to him so I could get another one.  Unfortunately, partnereu does not have 24/7help like register.com so I had to wait until the next day. I asked the billing person to please put a written note on the guy's desk to reset the account & e-mail me a newpassword.  The next day I got the same password a second timeand it did not work either.  The average wait time on all myphone calls was 15 minutes; the longest was 35 minutes.

I received a phone call on Friday from a register.com employee who said he was a supervisor.  I called back & let it ring 10 times without getting any voice mail.  I called Saturday, this time I was able to leave a phone message.  I checked to see if maybe this guy would be helpful and have e-mailed me a password, or reset my account so it would be up &  running for the weekend.  No such luck.

I sit here on my 13th day of great customer support waiting for the 2 minutes of assistance I need to get my business up & running.  I have spent over 10 hours during this time just trying to get access to the account that was transferred for me."

I am having my accounts transfered to another registrar for 1/2 of the cost this year.

Well, after a bazillion phone calls and worthless emails, someone at Register/PartnerEU finally gave me the answer they should've given me to begin with. Here it is.
</p>

<p>
Register.com is slowly moving their web based domain administration to a new domain name and setup. The domain name in question was moved first, before my others were, and the contact information was errornously matched to someone else. All Register.com domains will be slowly moving to the new administration.
</p>
<p>
To put it another way, the domain name is still mine. Not only that, but I got a free year of service for my troubles. The part that scares me is how many times is this going to happen for my other personal domains? Hell, I've got about 200+ domains under register.com at work. This should be fun to watch.

So, why do we hate Windows Media Player 9 again? I'm not sure anymore.
</p>
<p>
I'm all for the daily MicroShaft bashing. At one point in the past, I got sick of Windows Media Player, and decided to rip and convert my CDs to Ogg Vorbis. Even with a fast machine, and a fast CD drives, this takes time.
</p>
<p>
I recently did a reinstall on my new computer, and just did a restore of my old one; which also included the WMP9 upgrade on both. The ease of use from a "Copy From CD" standpoint, especially when you can just pop in a couple of CDs, let it rip them, then swap in a couple more,  seems a lot quicker than using CDEX and some of the other "open" formats and rippers.
</p>

<p>
Maybe it was the DRM crap? Or was the substandard MP3 quailty crap? Who knows. I can rip .WMA files with the copy protection turned off, and play them on my other Windblows boxes. So what's the downside again?
</p>

<p>
Maybe it's just faster ripping to WMA because it has better hooks into Direct*, and my Audigy2 card drivers. Either way. I think I might start [and finally finish] ripping my CDs to WMA format and be done with it.

I actually bought the $9.99 plug-in for Media Player that allows me to rip to MP3.  I don't mind WMA at all except that they are so LOUD.  Way too loud compared to MP3s.  It's impossible for me to have WMA and MP3 in the same playlist.

Interesting.  Under linux I run a program (well, actually a shell script) called 'abcde' (A Better CD Encoder) which takes a couple of args (-N -x IIRC) that simply auto-rips a cd to ogg and ejects the CD.  Re-insert new cd, hit uparrow+enter and repeat.  Or GRIP which will auto-rip on CD insertion and eject, so all you do is pop in CD after CD and close the drive when it pops out.

And it will do it into whatever format I want, ogg, mp3, wav, flaac, etc.  No DRM, no propriatory crap.

Maybe the quality of rippers under windows sucks badly compared to a shell script. Sad, but hey, as a monopoly MS can give you anything they want right?  Choice doesn't matter. 

Oh, and I think the reasons to hate WMP9 includes that whole "privacy" thing, and the propriatory nature of it all :)

So I woke up this morning at 5:45AM to the sound of a cornacopia of UPS beeping after a power failure.
Apparently a tree fell on a power linme one street over and fried about 4 transformers in the process.
</p>
<p>
I'm not to worried about the computer stuff. Just a couple of websites that will be fine once the power gets restored. 
What I do worry about is the damn sump pump in the basement. No power = wet basement. So, I drudged to the local Home Despot to finally purchase a backup sump pump, marine battery, battery fluid, schedule 40 1.5" PVC pipe, Y fitting, 2 check valves, 2 45 degree elbows, and some PVC cement.
</p>
<p>
In true St. Murphy fashion, the power came on just before I started cutting pipe. Guess I get to finish that all tomorrow.

Pepsi. Evil, evil Pepsi. That was (and still occasionally is) the anchor tied around my neck. I have to really pay attention because it is so reflexive to just buy one, that I can sometimes find myself with one in my hand even when I'm not (Not Dammit!) going to drink it.

Ok, now I finally remember why I turned away from using Windows Media Player and WMA/MP3 files: <strong>insane amounts of skipping</strong>. :-(
</p>
<p>
I've turned off SRS Wow effects. Turned off visualizations. Turned off the equalizer. Yet WMP skips like crazy  during playback if I try to do anything else. This is on a 3.4Ghz 1Gb Ram machine. Same goes for my dual 733Ghz at work. Then there's this insane 25%-40% CPU usage. #$%$#
</p>

<p>
The even stranger thing was that WMP rarely skipped when play Ogg Vorbis files. Wonder if WinAmp plays WMA files? Maybe I'll give that a try. I really don't want to take the longer time to rip everything to Ogg when WMP is much faster at that task.

<h2>If I had a hammer...</h2>

Contained within is a list of projects I'm doomed to never start, never work on and never complete. Come to think of it, it's more like a wishlist.

<h3><a id="icantfocus">icantfocus.com</a></h3>
Location: <a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/">http://today.icantfocus.com/</a>

You're looking at it. This is project #1. I haven't had a 'personal' website in ages. So, not only is my attempt to rehash one, but I'm also learning a lot of new stuff when building it.

Rather than stock <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, this site involves a lot of <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XML</acronym>/<acronym title="eXtensible Stylsheet Language">XSL</acronym>/<acronym title="Cascanding Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> code, plus a little <acronym title="Practical Extraction and Reporting Language">Perl</acronym> too.

<h3><a id="panyard">panyard.com</a></h3>
Location: <a href="http://www.panyard.com/">http://www.panyard.com/</a>

Of all the sites I've managed to get myself into between '95 and the present, this one has withstood the test of time. Unfortunately, it's written in <acronym title="Active Server Pages">ASP</acronym>/<acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> Server on Windblows NT 4.0 (<acronym title="Service Pack">SP</acronym> 6,000,000). Once I get a handle on Apache/AxKit/Perl, I'm going to start converting panyard.com to the new stuff. Most of the work involved will be building the shopping cart system with AxKit and Taglibs built in Perl.

<h2>Who's on first?</h2>

What's on second. Third base. I don't give a darn.

<h3><a id="who">Who?</a></h3>

Just the fax ma'm:

<ul>
	<li>my bills come addressed to Christopher H. Laco</li>
	<li>30ish years of age and counting</li>
	<li>there's no place more exciting than Akron, Ohio</li>
	<li>at work, they claim I am the Jack of all trades, Webmaster of none</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="what">What?</a></h3>

This sites construction is a huge departure from where I was a year ago. Not to mention that it probably is way more complicated than it has to be for 90% of it's content, but that is on purpose. :-)

Stop back later. I plan up creating a section under <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> that goes into great detail of how I built this site.

<h3><a id="when">When?</a></h3>

While you are reading this, I am furiously not working on this site. That's what the trained shaved monkeys are for.

<h3><a id="where">Where?</a></h3>

Good ole' Tallmadge, Ohio.  Yes, that's right. The excitement capital of northeast Ohio. NOT.

<h3><a id="why">Why?</a></h3>

This site is my attempt to get back into the website creation groove.

It's been far too long since I've had a personal website, and I need to scratch that itch. Plus, I have way to many opinions about various topics to keep under wraps any more. I've spent the last year or so maintaining existing websites @work and @home, and now it's time to get back on the wagon.

The other reasons I built this website:

<ol>
	<li>Because I can damnit, because I can!</li>
	<li>Force myself to get my new <a title="Toyz!!!!" href="/about/servers/">servers</a> operational.</li>
	<li>Get converted away from Windblows web development</li>
	<li>Learn more <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> stuffs</li>
	<li>The monkeys made me do it!@#$%</li>
	<li>Learn more <a href="http://www.perlmonks.com/">Perl</a> stuffs</li>
	<li>To much free time on my hands</li>
	<li>Learn more <a href="http://www.axkit.org/">AxKit</a> stuffs</li>
	<li>Taunt others from afar</li>
	<li>Learn more <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>stuffs</li>
	<li>And get converted away from Windblows webdevelopment!</li>
</ol>

I decided that the web server having write access to things was bad, so I've turned on suExec for my blog. This means all files are rebuilt as me. This also means that when comments are posted, the index page and the entry page will NOT reflect the comments immediately. A fare trade-off I think.

Okay Chris, what do you know that I don't? Yeah, yeah, lots of things, I'm sure, but comments not being posted immediately because of security? Is this something others using MT should be concerned about or...?

Well, it's all situational really. You can run the MT CGIs one of two ways: as the Apache user/group (www), or as a specifi or logged on user. If you run MT under the www account, Apache needs write access to generate your web files when you add a post, and when someone adds a comment. I'm no to fond of that.

So I decided to run the CGIs under my account via suExec. While this means all new entries write files as me and Apache doesn't need write access, it also means comments no longer work because Apache doesn't have write access.

I installed a set of patches from Sean Willson (http://www.seanwillson.com/archives/2003/04/27/000501/) that allowed me to turn off index rebuilds when comments are posted. I also hacked the MT::App::Comments and MT::App::Trackback modules to not rebuild entries when comment are posted.

I then installed mt-rebuild (http://mt-plugins.org/archives/mini/mtrebuild.php) and set up my crontab to schedule rebuilds of the index page and entries to display any new comments.

<h4>Keyboard Shortcuts (Access Keys)</h4>

This website makes use of keyboard shortcuts or "access keys" to make moving from item to item of section to section quicker for those who use the keyboard more than the mouse. On windows, these can be used by pressing <kbd>ALT +</kbd> the access key. On Macs you can use them by pressing <kbd>Control +</kbd> the access key.

The following access keys have been defined for use on every page of this site:

		<dd>Validate Current Page</dd>
</dl>

Access keys are also defined for each element in the forms used on this website. The access key for each form element will be underlined within the name or label for that element. For example, the access key for the field labeled <strong><span class="underline">N</span>ame</strong> would be <strong>N</strong>. Pressing <kbd>ALT+N</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>Control+N</kbd> on a Macintosh should bring focus to or place the cursor in the <strong>Name</strong> field.

Well, they're not moderated in the sense that there are approval forms and such. I just delayed their posting until I look at them, and a cron job runs to render the entry page again.

I've been thinking about another project I'll never get finished, or started.
</p>
<p>
When someone comments to a post on an MT blog, an email containing the comment goes to me. I think it would be cool if when I replied to that email, that a copy of the reply also went into a queue where a cron job could pick up the email, find the entry id, and add my reply to the blog comments.

I decided to tinker, so a few snippets are forthecoming.
</p>
<p>
First, I've got a few patches to allow MT to send the new comment notification to a CC: list of email addresses in addition to just the author's email. This is configurable in the MT blog preferences.
</p>
<p>
I'm also going to hack together a script that will suck in emails from a specified account and stuff their contents into the comments data for the entry specified in the subject line (assuming the email is a reply to the new comment notificaiton email).

While I think XP is a good improvement over Win2K and NT4, they all suffer from one (maybe two) really annoying 'features'.
</p>
<p>Whenever I have a mapped drive to a network share, or My Documents mapped to a network share, or network share history in the address toobar of IE....erm..I mean Windows Exploder, and the network or that network share becomes unavailable, the OS comes to a screeching halt.
</p>
<p>
Pulling down the address bar in IE takes minutes to time out before showing me internet addresses. Using windows explorer to navigate other shares and folder takes a minute to time out. Basically, a 'modern'  'multi-tasking' OS delays everything under the sun just because a network share goes away for a few minutes. Damn annoying.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the problem is magnified by the fact that windows eplorer is IE, and that fact that it is set to a single instance and thread. Sure, I can TweakUI it so each windows explorer instance is a new thread, but I shouldn't have to.

Hi,

I just wondered if you would know what to do to make IE/Explorer start as a new thread without using TweakUI. I guess it's something somewhere in the registry. 
Pretty bad that Microshred still forces an experienced user/sysop to handle even basic enhancements via the registry instead of just setting them as default.
Yours,
Mike

the reason rsync is so much faster is because it is designed to only send the *difference* between two copies of a file , while robocopy copies the *whole* file.  BTW , You can use rsync on Win32 ...

I stumbled across <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/PermaLink.aspx/c62c59bb-619e-4aa6-81f7-62f7716aa5e3">this post</a> on <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/">Korby Parnell's weblog</a>  aboutthe Visual Source Safe roadmap and furuture development progess. All I can say is I really really hope that some of the VSS developers take some time and use other things like <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a> and take some notes.
</p>
<p>
I've never been shy at work about my severe dislike of VSS after using CVS at home. The brannching/merging/tagging in VSS is plain old painful compared to CVS, especially for the less savvy users who use the VSS explorer having to sort through no end of folders that are branches and such other messes.
</p>
<p>
Don't even get me started about pinning. It always seemed so unnatural. I pin something to prevent a newer copy from getting deployed in Get Latest, yet I can't edit or checkout ANY version of that file. Grrrrr.
</p>
<p>
Let's not forget the spontanous corruption / combustion of the source database every now and again. Ouch.

BODY:
<p>
I've been thinking a lot lately about work, my enjoyment and distaste for it, and the seemingly large cycle that my work and home computing habits go through.
</p>
<p>
When I started my curent job 5 and a half years ago, I didn't know 1/4356th of what I know now. Some of my first projects were big ones that meant I spent weeks and months coding the same project. Back then there was just myself and one other doing programing and pages. After programing all day on the same project, I'd come home and do the same at home for another 5-6 hours. I was a true code monkey.
</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>
Over the years, I've had more meeting, more people, more projects, and the fun has left the building with Elvis somewhat. It seems the day to day modis operandi is to get projects done quickly instead of correctly. And as a programmer, correctly means the RIght Way using the propery tools and methods. We have so many options at our disposal; .NET, Web Services, Security Roles, XML Schemas; yet we never use them to their potential  because of time. I never get to code 8 hours straight for weeks on end because of the project of the week.
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong. I couldn't work with better people, and our group gets along like no other I've ever seen. I just can't seem to catch my learning/programming groove like I used to. Hell, I learned all the Unix junk at home just to keep myself amused. I've even got a website to convert from ASP to Unix that could keep me busy, but I can't seem to get into it.
</p>

<p>
Music was the same way. After about 5.5 years of music in college, I jumped ship to computers. Maybe it's time to jump top a new topic again.

Margo (aka 'Nurse' @ work) made the best green beans last night. Real, not canned, green beans trimmed, put in a ziplock bag, microwaved, then sprinkled with Tony's Cajun Creole salt/spice.  Yum yum.  And I'm not even a vegatable fan at all.

While I'm surfing and workin on the laptop, it's a given that I have the TV on as background noise. At least once a week without fail, I end up wondering across the same old movies over and over. There are a few however that I almost always watch.
</p>

<h4><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0096734">The Burbs</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
tressed out suburbanite Ray Peterson takes a week off work to just do nothing at home. However when a new family move into the street he notices strange things about them. With the input of his friend Art and his military minded neighbour Mark, he comes to the conclusion that they are part of a cannibalistic cult. They set out to get the proof.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Can got wrong with a Coryey Feldman movie right? Actually, I think the entire cast of neighbors was a good pick. We've got an average joe. A consiracy theorist. An ex war vet. And some stoners. Can't go wrong there.
</p>


<h4><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093828">Real Men</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
Jim Belushi plays a super-competent secret agent on the trail of Russian thugs. John Ritter plays a milquetoast dad who gets mixed up in the caper. The story follows their adventures over the course of a week, in which Ritter develops some guts and Belushi gets in touch with his sensitive side.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
One of my favorite parts of this movie is the woman Jim picks up in a bar. Prim. Proper. Hair tied up. Old style long dress. Glasses. The minute he gets her home, she's in a dominatrix outfit and has Jim tied up for punishment. :-)
</p>

<h4><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0096794">Always</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pete is a pilot who drops water on forest fires at very low heights. His intended Dorinda is also a pilot who doubles as a radio controller for the pilots who do this work. Pete always takes chances, confident that his skill will bring him through. One day it doesn't and he is killed. He finds himself returning as an invisible ghost who's presence is barely felt giving advice to his successor. Pete then finds that his successor is also falling in love with Dorinda.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Richard Dreyfuss and Jon Goodman may a funny duo in this flick with just the right mix of seriousness and slapstick.

<p>
I'm working on a not so new project at home. The goal is to use an existing RDBMS in an OODBMS way. I know, it's a project doomed to failure, but that won't stop me from trying. :-)
</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>
Essentially, I need to convert an old ASP driven site to something MySQL/Perl/XML driven. It's just your average run of the mill commerce site. But here's the kicker. Rather than just move the database from MSSQL to MySQL, I wan to revamp the schema completely.
</p>
<p>
If you've ever tinkered under the hood of MS Commerce Server, one of the things that stands out is how it stores part/product information. Rather than trying to make all parts fit into the same mold, part are grouped by type, and each type has it's own set of attributes. A CD and a wrench are the same, so why shove them into the same mold?
</p>
<p>
In a nutshell, you have tables thatg store the part definitions and other tables that store the part attributes. Instead of a part geing a single row with its attributes being the columns, each row is a different attribute name/value for a given part.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, the site I'm workin on has about 500 parts or so most of which are semi related. I've read the various Google newsgroup postings. The OODBMS vs. RDBMS seems like a religous topic at best. Worst case; it's a learning experience.

I used to live with him, so I had him in arm's reach for a few years and did nothing.

If I knew then how I would wind up being treated as a second-class citizen by him after he got a taste of small-time celebrity I might have kicked his ass when I had the chance.

Stupid me.  Always giving folks the benefit of the doubt.

Ever read a name or see a photo, and swear up and down you know that person but can't for the life of you remember how? I'm having one of those moments again.

I ran into <a href="http://www.brewedfreshdaily.com/2003_08_01_old.asp#106040678767805499">this post</a> over @ <a href="http://www.brewedfreshdaily.com/">Brewed Fresh Daily</a>. The guy on the left, Thomas Mulready, is the person in question. The face looks familiar. The name sounds familiar. I even got on a mailing list of his. But for the life of me, I can't put 2 and 2 together on how I know him. Strange.

I figured it out, I think. :-)

Thomas was the Director of Online Information Services at Management Recruiters International back in the mid to late 90's.

I interviewed there for a webmaster/programmer position either after I graduated college or after my first job ended (also in Cleveland).

Finally. That was going to bug me for a while.

Once I finished building my new PC, I had the task of reassembling my old HP Pavilion 771n. They're not the greatest machines on Earth, but I've been pretty lucky with them <em>before they and Cpmpaq merged</em>.
</p>
<p>
So like the retard I am, in a frenzy of taking my new rig to a LAN party I pulled the wrong cable and the 771n went crashing to the floor from about 4 feet up on a desk.
Parts went flying everywhere.  The case bezel. The bezel inserts. The top. The top CD lid. The top insert.  <strong>@#$%^!</strong>
</p>
<p>
Much to my surprise, <strong>nothing</strong> was broke. It all snapped back together without any problems, and the hard drive survived.  Kinda cool actually, not that I want to try it again anytime soon.

And not a drop to eat. First, the details. This latest round of email worms is just plain nasty. I woke up this morning to 120+ emails (marked correctly as spam by SpamAssassin) that are from infected machines on the net being sent to an old webmaster account that hasn't been used on the web in years. Not only that, but I've also received about 30+ MAILER-DAEMON responses to emails sent out by infected machines using that same webmaster emails address as the From: address.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I've checked the headers to make sure none of them actually came from my IP block. Thanks Postfix!.
</p>
<p>
So let me proclaim and jump on the bandwagon: <strong>SMTP Email Is Dead</strong>. Any internet protocol that can be brought to it's knees by simply falsifying the From: header simply needs to be shot dead and put to rest.
</p>
<p>
Time to go disable that old account now.

Well, I finally broke down and installed <a href="http://www.texturizer.net/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> this evening. Very nice. I much prefer the seperation of Mozilla into Firebird and Thunderbird.

<p>
As soon as the Thumderbird themes become as plentiful as the Firebird themes, I'll be even happier, especially ORbit 3+1 and Breeze.

Are you running it on a *nix box?  There seems to be a memory leak on windows boxes.  If you leave it up for a while, it gets sluggish and needs a reboot.

I'm running it on XP Pro, but I'm running a nightly build instead of the 0.1 release.

I haven't noticed a memory leak, but then again, it's 0.1 nightly build. I don't quite expect the world from it yet.

Since I've had to tinker myself to death twice to figure this out, trying every variation under the sun to avoid various path, @INC and working directory issues, I might as well post it here so I can find it again later after the next OS reinstall. :-)

<p>
<strong>
It appears that sometime around 3.0 M6 to M8, Eclipse changes the way it interacts with the Working Directory. What used to work, now doesn't. It appears now that I have to make the Working Directory ${project_loc} to get things to wkr as they should. Anyone got any more info on the changes?

<h2><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
If you're running the <strong><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net/">EPIC</a></strong>, the perl editing plugin for Eclipse, at some point you are going to want to run a script you're writing. At that point, you have two options: <strong>a)</strong> run it in a seperate command window, constantly switching back and forth between that and the IDE , or  <strong>b)</strong> try and convince Eclipse to run it behind the scenes and display the results in the <strong>Console</strong> view.
</p>
<p>
I'm lazy, so I chose the latter of the two. :-)
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, setting up the <strong>External Tools</strong> configuration to run my scripts within the IDE turned out to be harder than it should have been.
I'm sure part of that was due to <acronym title="I-D-10-T error between the chair and keyboard.">Pilot Error(TM)</acronym>. After some RTFMing and a quick scan of the Windows Command  Shell, I stumbled upon the solution below.
</p>

<h2><a id="setupsteps">Get On With It!</a></h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			First, open the <strong>External Tools</strong> configuration window (<strong><a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a></strong>)  by
			choosing <strong>Run -> External Tools -> External Tools...</strong> from the menubar as
			shown in <strong><a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a></strong> below.
		</p>
		<p class="image">
			<a href="/blog/images/perl/eclipse-runperl-figure1.png" id="figure1">

			</a>
			<br />
			<strong>Figure 1:</strong> Opening External Tools configuration window
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Next, highlight the <strong>Program</strong> entry in the <strong>Configurations</strong> box on the left (<strong><a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a></strong>) and click <strong>New</strong> button below
			to create a new configuration as shown in <strong><a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a></strong>.
		</p>
		<p class="image">
			<a href="/blog/images/perl/eclipse-runperl-figure2.png" id="figure2">
				<img src="/blog/images/perl/eclipse-runperl-figure2-thumb.png" alt="Figure 2: External Tools configuration window" />

			</a>
			<br />
			<strong>Figure 3:</strong> Creating a new configuration
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			In the <strong>Name</strong> field. type in the display name for this configuration. We're going to be creating a simple configuration to run Perl with warnings enable, so enter <kbd>perl -w</kbd>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the <strong>Location</strong> field, we will point Eclipse to use the command shell.
			By using the command shell instead of the perl executable, we can change directories and run anything we need to prior to actually
			running the perl script in question. The location of <kbd>cmd.exe</kbd> will vary depending on which MS OS you're using.
			I'm running XP Pro, so I entered <kbd>C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe</kbd>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the <strong>Working Directory</strong> box, I pointed it to <kbd>C:\WINDOWS\system32</kbd>, the same location as <kbd>cmd.exe</kbd>.
			There is probably no reason to do so, but what the hell. It can't hurt right?
		</p>
		<p>
			Now for the magic. In the <strong>Arguments</strong> box I entered the following
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:left;">
			<kbd>/C "cd ${container_loc} &amp;&amp; perl -w ${resource_name}"</kbd>
		</p>
		<p>
			What is all that junk anyhow? Here's a breakdown.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>[cmd.exe] /C</strong></dt>
			<dd>Carries out the command specified by string and then terminates</dd>

			<dt><strong>cd ${container_loc}</strong></dt>
			<dd>Change directory to the directory containing the currently selected perl script in the IDE</dd>

			<dt><strong>perl -w ${resource_name}</strong></dt>
			<dd>Run the selected perl script using perl.exe with warnings turned on</dd>
		</dl>


<p><em>
<strong>Note:</strong> I used <kbd>perl</kbd> instead of <kbd>wperl</kbd> because I'm running the 1.4.x runtime. If I use <kbd>wperl</kbd> instead, I actually get the quick DOS popup window even though <kbd>wperl</kbd> is modeless , <strong>Run in background</strong> is checked, and the 1.4.x runtime supposedly fixed this issue (<a href="http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net/faq.html#A_DOS_box_flashes_on_the_screen_can_it">EPIC FAQ Entry</a>). I suspect the opposite would happen if I were using the 1.3.x runtime.</em></p>

		<p>
			After entering the data above, click <strong>Apply</strong>. You should end up with something looking like <strong><a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a></strong>.

		<p class="image">
			<a href="/blog/images/perl/eclipse-runperl-figure4.png" id="figure4">

			</a>
			<br />
			<strong>Figure 4:</strong> Enter Main configuration values
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Next, click on the <strong>Common</strong> tab in the configuration you just created and click the <strong>External Tools</strong> checkbox in
			the <strong>Display in favorites menu</strong> (<strong><a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a></strong>) settings group
			and click <strong>Apply</strong>. Then hit <strong>OK</strong> to close the External Tools window.

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Highlight a perl script of your choosing in the <strong>Navigator</strong> view and pick your configuration from the <strong>Run -> External Tools</strong> menu.

There, that wasn't to so bad.

THANKS for your help.  Am just starting with Perl have written unix scripts in the past.

The eclipse/perl addin from Jochen Luell works just fine and your config to get eclipse to run it works just fine.

Now, I need to learn how to create .pm vs .pl files so a main routine can call a subroutine....

An easier solution is to only indicate in "Location" the path to perl (/usr/bin/perl for ex.). Anything in "working directory" and as "arguments" write:  -w ${resource_loc}

True, it is easier, but I've had problems in the past (at least on Windows) where the current working directory and @INC is based on where you're running perl from, and not where the script itself resides due to using the full script path. Usualy this was a problem when trying to develop CPAN modules and test them in the local ./lib or ./blib directory.

Plus, (and maybe I need to create an extended example), using cmd.exe instead allows me to prepend additional commands that perform make clean and make before I run the actual Perl script in question.

I'm just starting to play with eclipse and was wondering how to do just this... now I know.

I also use an editor called crisp and it has a nice way to keep a library of code snips easily available to paste into my code.  Are you aware of anything like that for eclipse... 

I write a lot of perl and find myself just pasting previous chunks together.  Yes I use modules but you still need the supporting code around the modules to make it all work.

Thanks again for this web page...

Great Job!  Very useful , works without problem.  
I want to include some arguments  for the perl script  e.g. 
first.pl my_file  
where  my_File is full path name and this program open the file to do some operations.  I tried to put the arguments 
"c:\temp\my_file.txt" , it does not work, also tried to include the my_file in the project,  does not work. 
Any suggestions. 
thanks in advance

Thanks for the tip.

On windows however, you need to change drive first if Eclipse (F:) and the perl application (G:) aren't on the same drive.
I did this by putting changing the arguments to:

/C "g: &amp;&amp; cd  ${container_loc} &amp;&amp; perl -w ${resource_name}"

Hi,
I have just tried the C:\Perl\bin approach before visiting here, and found that both come up to same conclusion. However there is a problem, the strings you print during program execution are not diplayed on console window (on Eclipse) until the program is terminated (run to end). So, if the pl script continuously reads stuff from STDIN, you cannot see the printouts. Is there a solution? I would be gratefule if you can mail me, or at least post here any ideas. Thank you.

Kemal.

Windows users may need to change directory by using "cd /D" (this avoids hardcoding the drive letter as shown above)

I just finished solving the problem of switching drives that other people have already solved and posted. 
Unfortunately, I only found the solution after I knew what it was. So, for the benefit of the next person to run into this, I am posting the error message and symptom along with the fix.

Can't open perl script

If you get this it may be that you need to specify your drive letter. Please see previous messages with solution.

I'm on linux. This works great. The only point I'd like to add is that to use Erick's solution (2nd message posted). Make sure to include your workspace path in the "Perl Include Path". 

1. right-click on the perl project folder you're using
2. go to properties
3. add the current directory to the include paths

My script wasn't working until I made this change.

You can specify arguments by including one of the Eclipse-supplied variables on your command line.  If you use "${string_prompt}", Eclipse will pop up a dialog when you Run; "${file_prompt}" will pop up a file selection box.  You can enter multiple arguments in one string_prompt...

Unfortunately, 3.0M7 is a bit stoopid, and right after the argument dialog pops up, it pops up a small yellow banner-ish thing at the bottom of the main eclipse window, which submerges the argument dialog under the window (so you have to alt-tab back to it).  Annoying, but minor.

I must be missing something. Eclipse doesn't recognize string_prompt as a valid variable, so it won't actually let you save this in the external program configuration, at least w/eclipse 2.1.3 on a windows platform.

when running a perl script on windows XP using your configuration i had the folowing error
"Can't open perl script : No such file or directory", the solution to this error is to change the parameter option on the external tools to   /C "cd ${container_loc} &amp;&amp; perl -w ${container_loc}\${resource_name}"  as the CD didn't do it for me. I hope this helps others that might had the same problem. Thanks for your article wich was very helpfull to me. Regards

I cannot not make arguments work (my arguments contain blanks!).

/C "cd ${container_loc} && perl -w ${resource_name} ${container_loc}\input.txt" 

I want to pass ${container_loc}\input.txt as an argument, but the path ${container_loc} contains blanks (C:\Documents and Settings\...). Perl receives only the partial string "C:\Documents" and cannot find my input.txt file.

I also tried this /C "cd ${container_loc} && perl -w ${resource_name}" "${container_loc}/input.txt" but it doesn't help.

Does the EPIC perl plugin for Eclipse support refactoring of perl scripts?

Eclipse on wxp here:

/C "cd /D ${container_loc} && perl -w ${resource_name} ${string_prompt}"

with $|=1 in the perl script does the magic.

Not my idea of course, extracted from the comments...

Hello,

Great article sir.It was very helpful.
I am trying to run perl script which takes multiple files as command line argument &amp; process those files.
So can anybody please tell me the variable which opens window exactly like when we use ${string_prompt} variable, but where can I choose folders or multiple files.

Thanks,
kalai

If you're on OS X, here's a way to have Eclipse prompt you for a file to submit to your perl script:

Location:
/bin/tcsh

Working Directory:
${project_loc}

Arguments
-c "cd ${project_loc} &amp;&amp; /usr/bin/perl -w ${resource_name}

Another tip for Linux / BSD / Solaris / OS X:

Some users may have problems seeing output from certain scripts.  To fix it, you must redirect the output to stdout, like so:

-w ${resource_loc} &>1

Note the "&>1".  This should go in the arguments section.

<p>Is there any way to add the non-buffering of stderr ($|=1;) to the arguments so I don't have to put it in every file?</p>

<p>- I assigned my Eclipse workspace directory to a directory other than the default & it turned out that Eclipse/Perl did not like spaces in any directory names in the path to the one I chose. I farted around a bit to see if there was an obvious way to correct this, didn't find any, and then just replaced spaces in my directory names with underscores. Hork!</p>

I've used EPIC on Windows for at least a year and have been quite happy. But recently I've had to do some work on a Mac and the configuration there is driving me nuts.

No matter what I do when setting variables my arguments are always prepended with whatever variable is selected in the variable list. I don't want any of them but can't find a way to choose none. Because I can't every attempt to run "perl -w" fails with an error regarding "${build_project} -w ${resource_loc}", or "{some_other_unwanted_variable} -w ${resource_loc}".

Please help me before I just give up on EPIC on the Mac.:-)

I'm running on Windows XP.
Try the following if you have "cd" problem.

Location : C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe
Working Directory : ${container_loc}
Arguments : /C "perl -w ${resource_name}"

Test environment is
Eclipse 3.1

Starting sometime in the last month, Sham Warner/Choad Runner decided it would be a wise idea to block all incoming email from "Residential" internet users. To bad I'm a fucking Business user. Repeat after me: <strong>DSL does not always equal residential customer</strong>.  Butt huggers.

Now I have to wade through god knows how many people and forms just to get their DNS to delegate reverse lookups for my IP block to my servers. That should be fun to explain.

With a little Postfix magic, two can play this game.

Ya know, you have me curious. A quick googling for ["headers only" Thunderbird] yields nothing, not even discussions about it.

I remember, when I used Mozilla Mail that it never downloaded the full messages unless junk controls were on (because it needed to calc the whole message, not just headers). So, I wonder if the default is the do headers only for IMAP accounts?

Id like to know how I can configure multiple accounts using the same SMTP server...

Example:
I have 5 acounts hosted @formatur.com.br

Each time I need to send a email, I need to send it by the same server (smtp.formatur.com.br) BUT I need to log on the server with the account name and its respective password.

And it goes like this:

cgracio@formatur.com.br
smtp.formatur.com.br
pwd: XXXXX

convites@formatur.com.br
smtp.formatur.com.br
pwd: YYYYY

formatur@formatur.com.br
smtp.formatur.com.br
pwd: ZZZZZ

Sorry `bout the poor english, I`m brazilian!

I have multiple SMTP servers added under the Advanced tab, but when I switch between trying to send email at home or at school (diff SMTP servers), Thunderbird seems to only look at which one is listed on top.  Is there a place where I tell it to try the next one down if the first one doesn't work?  I found out how to designate which server my differnet accounts should use, but I use both email accounts at both locations.

Roles. Internal SQL Groups. A way to abstract the who-can-do-what kind of details. Sounds good right? Not exactly.
</p>
<p>
I had one simple mission this morning: create a set of roles in MSSQL and write a stored procedure to return a list of user rights based on which roles they're in. Once the roles were written, and user accounts and domain groups were added to those roles, it looked like a simple matter of running <kbd>IS_MEMBER(<em>'role name'</em>)</kbd> in T-SQL and creating a resultset.
</p>
<p>
Much to my dismay, try as I might, I couldn't get this to work for my current login using NTLM. As it turns out, the <kbd>IS_MEMBER()</kbd> function does absolutely <strong>nothing</strong> when the current login is a member of the System Administrators role #$#@*!  Just because someone is an admin in the local server <strong>doesn't mean they should be all poweful in the dataase all of the time</strong>. At least have the damn function return accurate results.
</p>
<p>
From better to worse it seems. The only way to remove myself from the SysAdmin role is to remove myself from the Domain Admins group on that server, whi9ch means I can't administer that server, and logging into the server as a generic server admin account is even worse since it doesn't allow us to know who did what when everyone administrates with the same generic account. Damnit! That make roles just about worthless in my book.

Almost. :-) Over the last 5 weeks or so I've finally stopped saturating my body with caffine. Not Coke. No Pepsi, or Mt. Dew. I'll still drink an occasional Caffine Free Dient Coke when it apears, and if we go out to eat, I'll usually take the least horid thing I can; tea, or caffine free root bear. Considering I drink nothing but water at work, a little tea at lunch won't kill me.
</p>
<p>
During that time,  I also dropped mass consumption of french fries with my ckicken or burger at lunch. Oh how I miss those loaded cheese fries at Outback. :-) Mo Mo is actually keeping me eating veggies too which is an impressive feat.

One thing is for sure,  I don't suffer from the mid afternoon food coma at work. Always a good thing.

An <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/08/28/structuralVsSemantic">interesting trail</a> found over at <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Simon Wilson's site</a> and leading back to <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/08/030826standards_do.html">kottke.org</a>  about semantic and structural markup and content.
</p>
<p>
The discussion of semantics vs. structure vs. syntax and validation in *ML took a different turn for me today.  I usually understand the argument of semantical markup vs. structural markup. I must admit though that I've always approached it from the side of layout <em>first</em>, then content second. In other words, if I used &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; for menus, it was simply because I <em>should</em> use it instead of a gaggle of &lt;div&gt; tags.
</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>
That's ok I thought. It's certainly a step ahead of where I used to be. But I still find myself constantly misusing other tags like &lt;kbd&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;. Why is that? I could be a simple case of lack of practice.  But I also think it's a matter of tagname-&gt;semantics translation.
</p>
<p>
I'm in the proecess of wiriting some API documentation for various projects and just started looking at <a href="http:/www.docbook.org/">DocBook</a>.
Now that I'm focused on writing content first and layering markup on top of it, instead of writing the markup in mind first, it makes me think that part of what causes poor semantic HTML is the tagnames themselves.
</p>
<p>
In HTML I need to highlight the name of a file. Should it be &lt;tt&gt;, &lt;samp&gt;, or &lt;kbd&gt;?  Sometimes it's clear. Sometimes it's not. But in DocBook, it doesn't get more clear than &lt;filename&gt;.
</p>
<p>
I'm now even considering converting the contents of this site into DocBook format.  Rather than struggle with which tag to use, it may turn out to be easier to use tags that are already a little more clear. But that's just me.

Since I'm thinking about <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000312/">converting parts of this site to use DocBook</a>, it would be nice to have a decent XML editor for Eclipse.  The Inprise XSLT plugin is OK, but it crashes at lot editing files on server shares for some reason, Maybe that's an Eclipse or Java problem.
</p>
<p>
Either way, I stumbled across the <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/">oXygen XML Editor</a> that comes in both standalone and Eclipse plugin versions. IT even comes with DocBook support which si real handy when you're just learning the Docook schema and the plugin does content asist and tag completion based on any DTD.
</p>
<p>
There are also two other qualitiedsI really like in software. First, the price is reasonable. At $79 for the professional version I won't think twice about paying for it. And second, the license allows for me to use it anywhere I'm sitting. That means I can use it at home and at work. I wish MickeyShaft would learn that feature.

<p>
A while back I <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000259/">praised Windows Media Player</a> for being so good at ripping CDs quickly. Then I also ranted about the WMA format sucking ass because it's <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000263/">skipping randomly</a> on every computer I owned, where my old Ogg Vorbis files did not skip.
</p>
<p>
Well after some more tinkering I've narrowed the problem down to DirectShow and the DirectOutput crap in DirectX. The minute I turned off DirectOutput in WinAmp, the skipping went away. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a way to turn of DirectOutput in WMP, so that player is out of the loop.
</p>
<p>
At this point, I'm starting from scratch, and need to decide to rip WMA or Ogg Vorbis again. WMA is definately faster but since I'm not going to be using WMP for playback and it's library functions, what's the point? Chances are I'm not going to get a portable devies anytime soon, and by them some of them wil already have Ogg Vorbis support.

keep away from WMA as far as you can, avoid it like the plague. It got microsoft cooties all over, and sucks ass at audio quality.

use something as MP3, or like said, AAC. It kicks ass

I'm not sure when it started, but I'm completly addicted to <a href="http://www.franksredhot.com/article.asp?articleid=17">Frank's RedHot
Cayenne Pepper Sauce</a>. Not too hot, but just enough kick and a good flavour.
</p>
<p>
The local pizza place sells Buffalo Chicken pizza. Instead of pizza sauce, they use [what tastes just like] Frank's RedHot, topped with diced chicken and cheese. Of course, I add some more Frank's at home when it's being consumed.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.margeauxsplace.com/blog/">M</a> also makes a simple concoction on occasion: ~50% mayonnaise, ~%49.5 Frank's RedHot, and ~%.05  <a href="http://www.davesgourmet.com/">Dave's Insanity Sauce</a>. Quite potent, and sticks to everything it can on the way down [and out].

Where did the three day weekend go? I spent Saturday <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000317/">cleaning my office</a>. Sunday she woke to a flat tire on her car, which means I have to take her to work. After that I spen tmost of the morning and afternoon getting new tires, grocery shopping (during the hour they were doing the car), and getting junk from Home Despot.
</p>
<p>
I need to mow the yard, trim, spray weed killer, clean the garage, and put gravel in the window wells.
Didn't happen yesterday because I was tired and it rained for a while. Doesn't look like it's going to happen today either since it's raining off and on again, still, more. Maybe tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
And of course, the grill is out of gas, not that it matters in this weather. Guess we'll clean the house or something.

I'm not a great cook, and I say following recipes to the letter is for the birds. With those two things in mind give this "chicken death" a try. Guaranteed for a few hours of misery.
</p>

<ul>
<li>2 packages of Louis Rich fully cooked Southwestern chicken strips</li>
<li>1 diced white onion</li>
<li>1 diced green bell pepper</li>
<li>1 diced red bell pepper</li>
<li>2-3 diced red fresno peppers. bonus points for habaneros instead</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>franks redhot sauce</li>
</ul>

<p>
Fry it all together how you like it and melt desired cheese on top. Put sour cream, cheese on a tortilla shell, then the chicken death, then more hot sauce. </p>
<p>
Fold. Eat. Regret.

I'm currently in the process of creating hardware requirements for a dream machine to host both an older MSSQL's databases, be the master server in replication, and house a new database project with heavy reads and heavier writes. Having <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000199/">dealt with disk I/O issues</a> in the past, I tend not to want to have them again, especially for something that will have even more disk writes than reads. It would be nice to have the old stuff and the new stuff seperated so they wouldn't fight for disk I/O.
</p>
<p>
I know this will never fly, but I'll try it anways and see how it goes. :-)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some large rack mount chassis with many PCI slots</li>
<li>2 2.5Ghz HyperThreading Xeons (expandable to 4)</li>
<li>4GB Ram (expandable to 12GB)</li>
<li>Tempdb: <strong>Controller 1</strong> w/ external <strong>RAID 1E0</strong></li>

I'm sure the price tag on all of that will make the hair stand up on any PHB within a mile. Rumor has it that IBM has finally released an EXP400 enclosure that uses the new Ultra320 15,000RPM SCSI drives and a new ServeRAID 6M Ultra320 RAID card to consume them. Yummy.

Got a phone call last night from my friend Chris from work who is building a computer for his boy. He snagged a used ASUS mobo and a P3 1.4Ghz only to find out that the mobo won't take a 1.4 due to the multipliers and bus.1 But what do you know, I have (3) 1U P3 1Ghz  servers that will take a 1.4, and he needs a 1.0Ghz.
</p>
<p>
So now the web server has been upgraded to a P3 1.4Ghz. :-) Bonus.
</p>
<p>
I think I need to recompile the kernel though.  It actually seems a tad slower although it's running at the same bus speeds. MRTG seems to confirm this a little. Either that, or a reboot has reset something I didn't finish somewhere.
</p>

Found the problem. The P3-S 1.4 has no L2 cache. The old P4 1.0 had 256k L2. Guess it makes a difference.

After the BIOS upgrade, the "external cache" (L2) option was set to "Disabled". How stupid. Resetting it to "Write-Back" solved my problems and now everything is zipping along nicely.

Yet with all that energy (not), I can't seem to get anything done with the second half of <a href="/projects/">this yet</a>. I think part of it is that I need to write my tests first (<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment">TDD</a>) before I even get around to writing the code. THe tests alone for all the methods in one module is more work the the code itself. I know it'll pay off later, but damn it it takes too long! Sniff sniff. Whine, bitch, moan.

Well, leave it to MCI to be completely clueless about all things billing. Just a quick synopsis for those just tuning in.
</p>
<ul>
<li>~2001 - Enroll in 24/7 Unlimitied usage ISDN package</li>
<li>April 2002 - WorldSham/MCI starts billling us for hourly usage</li>
<li>Call in get it corrected</li>
<li>May 2002 - more hourly usage charges on an unlimited account</li>
<li>Call in get it fixed</li>
<li>This pattern continues until we cancel account in November 2002</li>
<li>Spend December 2002 until July 2003 still trying to get account credited for misbilled hours</li>
</ul>
<p>
The finally in July we received the following email and also a snail mail invoice to the same effect:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Account xxxxxxxxxx has already been credited in the amount of $2,976.39.
Account xxxxxxxxxx ISDN connect hours billed incorrectly from
05/02/02-06/02/02.
Service was to receive unlimited usage, this adjustment will be reflected on
the
07/01/03 invoice.
</p>
<p>
Thank you, for your patience.

So guess what we got in the mail today? <strong>A fucking letter from Harvard Collections Services for $2993.17 on behald of MCI.</strong>. No wonder these people are getting sued twelve ways from Sunday. Unfucking believable.

I scored a 122. They rate me a Visual Mathematician, which means that this test is exactly worth squat, or at least in my case.

I hurt. Plain and simple. Yesterday I trimmed the weeds, put gravel in the window sills, and rounded up the fallen weeds, and applied weed killer to the driveway and sidewalks. Then I went to maso-therapy o get my back/side/front fixed. Then I went to Lowes and got more gravel and put more inthe windows sills before I crashed for the evening. Damn I'm sore.

I still have to (at least) mow the yard and install the new wood blinds i nthe kitchen. OK, I'll stop wining now.

<p>
While not remotely complete, listed below are a few movies that intrigue me for one reason or another.
</p>

<ul>

<li><h4><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307479/">Solaris</a></h4>
<p>
This movie seemed to get a log of bad reviews, but I liked it. Any movie that leaves me thinking and questioning things at the end can't be that bad.
</p>
</li>

<li><h4><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/">Vanilla Sky</a></h4>
<p>
I consider myself a fairly bright person considering what I do for a living. I had to watch this movie a second time to "get it".
</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0120663/">Eyes Wide Shut</a></h4>
<p>
I still don't get this one. I managed to appreciate other Kubrick films, even <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/">A Clockwork Orange</a>, but this film lost me completely.
</p>
</li>


<li><h4><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0102900/">Shattered</a></h4>
<p>
The ending on this one is quite the surprise. I also like movies that keep me from guessing the correct plot ending.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

Geekery.  FreeBSD advocacy.  The occasional mention of Perl (and/or other programming languages).

That, plus I enjoy it when you bitch about SQL Server ;).

Just stumbled across it, browsing for perl editors and ended up spending half an hour browsing..

I guess it was the humour which spiced the topics - " Geekery. FreeBSD advocacy." the house and cats- that hooked me :)

If I had one wish today, it would be that my cats could speak 5 minutes of English and tell me what the hell is going on around the house.
</p>
<p>
Ever since <a href="/blog/images/offtopic/buttons.jpg">Buttons</a> broke her leg, the Siamese sisters (<a href="/blog/images/offtopic/neiko.jpg">Neiko</a> &amp; <a href="/blog/images/offtopic/isis.jpg">Isis</a>) attack her sister <a href="/blog/images/offtopic/babs.jpg">Babs</a>. Babs of course is to nice to fight, and runs away which encourages them even more. Babs is a 14 pounder. The Siamese are 4 pounds each.
In the past, Babs would not go to the litter box which caused a bladder/urinary infection which manifested itself as her peeing on me in bed. That's certainly one way to tell your owner something is wrong. Since then we've kept the Siamese and the black sisters on separate floors,  rotating them to the opposite floor every night.
</p>
<p>
It's been a long time since she did that; until today of course. While we were gone, she peed all over the bed. No Siamese were down. No signs of infection (after yet another vet visit). All I ask is 5 minutes: tell me what's wrong.
</p>
<p>
Now it's not like these cats don't get attention. They're on us like a fly on stink when we're home. Never were there 4 other cats in the world so spoiled. Go figure. Clean up and move on I guess.

Well, after 3 days, I finished Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy on the first difficulty level.
I think the end boss was a little easier than in JK2: Jedi Outcast, but it was fun none the less. JA is going to be more fun to play again because I can choose levels in different orders, switch to duel sabers, and use a different character. 
I really like the fact that you play 5 missions, any order, then have to complete one big mission. Then another 5 missions and another big one.

In an effort to get rid of some large quantity of sloppy joes last week, we decided to take a chance and attempt to make veggie soup. Some diced carrots, diced potatoes, corn, celery, onions, tomato sauce, beef broth and box of noodles later the deed was done. It was pretty good, although it as veggie paste the next day requiring much more water to thin it back out. No one died or went to the hospital, to it was a success.

No matter how many times I here it, I still get a chuckle for even commercial or comic skit that uses <a href="http://www.80stvthemes.com/ra/MONDAYNITE.ra">this (RealAudio)</a> and other NFL themes as a background theme, while some voice over talks about something stupid like getting somewhere or getting something to work like it's a life and death struggle. The latest DirectTV commercial comes to mind about "Bob"  getting a big screen, then a curve ball thrown at him by "regional programming schedules".
</p>
<p>
I wish I could find the rest of the themes they typically use in these commercials so I could make my own. :-)  Having worked at an advertising agency in the past where they also did commercials, I can respect the creativity into stupid things like this, and the strange yet funny people behind them.
</p>
<p>
I also think those <a href="http://dirk.wikernet.com/bud/">Budweiser  "Real American Hero" or "Real Men Of Genius"</a> beer commercials are funny. "Mr Company Computer Guy".

Not that this will surprise anyone, but at least someone is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/09/23/protest.lawsuit.ap/">taking the Bush administration to task</a> for this kind of behaviour.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ACLU complaint lists several incidents where protesters were forced to assemble blocks away from where the president or vice president was speaking, while supporters of the administration's policy could hold their signs up in front of the building.

That is how CDs need to be priced, and the lack of a sane price is part of the reason why people will get them online instead.

Yes, but instead the recording companies keep their prices sky high, and spend their time and money on dragging 12-year-olds into court.

Dave Matthews was also a major supporter of Napster. There is obviously no love lost between him and the recording companies.

This is a great looking site!

Haha! I've just been through that whole 'finding a house that you like' routine. Good luck, I hope that one suits you.

Well, we went and looked at <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000354/">this house</a> tonight. This is the one IMHO. I wish I could show you pictures, but we broke the camera (thanks St. Murphy!) and ended up with about 10 pictures of pure black nothing. Go figure.
</p>

<h4>General House Info</h4>
<p>
First, the entire first floor is hardwood floors. Wood trim everywhere, and every door in the house is <strong>solid</strong> oak. The house is 6 years old, but you would swear up and down that no human has ever lived there. Not a scratch or dent anywhere: and impresive feat considering tghe amount of wood inthe house.
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, and the first floor ceilings are 9' tall! Woohoo!
</p>

<h4>Great Room/Family Room (13 x 23)</h4>
<p>
Along with the hardwood floor and wood trim, there is also huge crown molding in this room. There is a fireplace in the middle. My onle complaint is that lack of any built in lighting. Easily fixable, but there's plenty of room for lamps everywhere.
</p>

<h4>Dinette (10 x 11)</h4>
<p>
Off of the Great Room and in front of the foyer is the Dinette. It's big enough to be the dning room all by itself. Behind it is a double door out onto the deck. And have I mentioned it has hardwood floors?
</p>

<h4>Kitchen (11 x 10)</h4>
<p>
The kitchen is as big as the Dinette. All hardwood cabinets. Large stainless sink. Disposal. <strong>Dishwasher!!!!</strong> Stove. Fridge. Oh yeah, and hardwood floors!
</p>

<h4>Dining Room (13 x 11)</h4>
<p>
The dining room is on the opposite side of the house form the Great Room. It's huge by itself. I had not idea what we'd do with it, but we'll manage! Oh yeah, and hardwood floors! :-)
</p>

<h4>Bedroom #1 (17 x 10)</h4>
<p>
This one is bigger than the master bedroom on its own. The real gem though is the L shaped <strong>walk-in</strong> closet between it and the Master Bedroom. It's huge! It could holz one million [in Dr. Evil pinky to mouth grin] pairs of shoes!
</p>

<h4>Bedroom #2 (12 x 11)</h4>
<p>
While not that big (still huge compared to what we have now) this bedroom has a huge closet. This house is all about the closet space it seems. That's good. We have a lot of crap.
</p>

<h4>Master Bedroom (11 x 15)</h4>
<p>
While this room is a little narrow, it has two wonderful things: the walk-in closet, and the private master bath! Awesome!
</p>

<h4>Master Bath</h4>
<p>
The master bath has the usual toilet, sink, huge sink cabinet, and a 4' shower. No tub. This sounds bad at first, but a) the 2nd bathroom in the hallway has a tub, and b) the master bathroom has a <strong>huge</strong> closet that is the SAME SIZE as the master bath itself. If you wanted to tear out a wall and make it a huge bath, you could.
</p>

<h4>Upstairs Bath</h4>
<p>
Nothing too special. Toilet. SInk. Huge sink cabinet. Tub. Shower.
</p>

<h4>Basement</h4>
<p>
The basement is wide open. The used a steal I-beam to support the upper floors.
Painted. Sealed. Double sump pumps (Yes, I will install batter backup pumps!). You could finish 2/3 of it into a rec room in no time flat.
The basement has a back door directly to the back yard.  That will make getting things into the basement lot easier.
</p>

<h4>Garage</h4>
<p>
It's a 2.5 car garage. Finished walls. Cold water pipage. Door w/ opener. :-)
There is also a back door to the back yard.
</p>

<h4>The Grounds (110x360)</h4>
<p>
The fornt yard is nothing special. Some landscaping, but it's got plenty of room for tender loving care. A gravel driveway hopefully to become concrete someday. The back yard has a firepit.A little soggy in the middle. Could use a couple loads of topsoil to raise the grade towards the woods. As we have woods! I went back aways, but didn't find the fence.

It wasn't Murphy, it was the ghosts. The house is evil, plus it has no fence and opens on woods. Evil I tell you. EVIL.

<p>
After seeing the house, and sleeping on it, the stress starts to set in.  The yard in this one bugs me. Maybe it's the soggy back yard, or the gravel driveway; both fixable.
</p>
<p>
I drove by a couple other houses on the list tonight, and we're going to go see them soon. The yard on one is awesome, and the rooms are about the same plus a 1rst floor laundry room and partialy finished basement.
</p>
<p>
The second one has a huge yard, and the house as really far from the road. Like the first, it has a concrete driveway.  Four bedrooms instead of three, but they're smaller. A garden tub in the master bath. But no fireplace.
</p>
<p>
We'll know more when we see them inside. It's easy to fix a yard. It's hard to pass up a house with all hardwood floors, solid hardwood doors,  and 9' ceilings on the first floor,  and the walkout basement.
</p>
<p>
It's going to be a long tough decision.

The counter offers' counter offer was accepted. The contract has been ammended, signed and returned. All loan paperwork has been gathered.
</p>
<p>
Monday we start the loan paperwork and inspections. After that, it's all downhill until closing, which is ~November 3rd!
</p>
<p>
Then the real fun begins. Moving. Cleaning and painting the old house. And selling it. Hopefully it will go somewhat quickly. Afterall, it has a new roof and gutters/spouts (this year), new windows (4 years), waterproof basement (drains + sump + sealer) (2 years), sump pump and batter backup sump pump (this year), entirely new bathroom (2 years), repainted/trimmed/floored kitchen (this year), new stainless steel sink and disposal (this year), and central air (4 years).
</p>
<p>
It's not the cutest place on the block on the outside, but it sure has a lot fixed on the inside already.

Also known as "Dear Excel, stop fucking changing my data!".
</p>
<p>
As you may or may not know, if you need to create an Excel spreadsheet "on the fly" from a web server and the server doesn't have Excel installed, and the server doesn't have any Excel generating components installed, you can simply create HTML tables and Excel will parse and load that as an Excel file. Happy days.
</p>
<p>
Now for the bad news. Excel, just like the rest of Orifice likes to think for you and fuck with what you actually type into the document. Prime example: fractions.
</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>
If you send the following document  to Excel:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;table&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;1 1/16&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/table&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Excel will gladly open the document with one column with a value of <samp>1 1/16</samp> in the first cell.
But if you highlight that cell, the data entry box at the top shows <samp>1.0625</samp>. <strong>!@#$%</strong>.
</p>
<p>
To make matters worse, if you save the file, the value of <strong>1.06525</strong> is saved. If you try and import the file into a 
database using an Excel drivers (OLEDB/SQL Server), <samp>1.0625</samp> is the value imported, not <samp>1 1/16</samp>.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say this is frustrating. I just want Excel to leave my shit alone. Do what I tell you damnit!
</p>
<p>
Luckily after some tinkering, and saving Excel files as HTML documents, I found the answer/hack/solution.
One single CSS style declaration and the addition of a <samp>&lt;col&gt;</samp> tags can tell Excel to treate every fields as a
Text field rather than trying to "guess" what I want for me.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;style&gt;
		.leaveitalone {mso-number-format:"\@";}
	&lt;/style&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;table&gt;
			&lt;col class="leaveitalone"&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td class="leaveitalone"&gt;1 1/16&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/table&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Open the updated version in Excel, and <samp>Right Click</samp> -> <samp>Format Cells</samp> on the first cell and whola, the format is <samp>Text</samp> instead of  <strong>General</strong>. Now Excel will finally leave your data alone.

Unfortunately this only works for some values - try putting "SomeText+BK-R" (without the quotes) in the cell and Excel still manages to fuck this one up. 

Goddammit!!!! Leave it alone!!!!

All right, I can't look too closely at it right now... maybe later; but the regex spooked me.

s/\s*(.*?)\s*/$1/;

I doubt that will does what you want.  You might want to split that into two:

s/^\s+//;s/\s+$//;

Take a look at the following:
-------------------------------
my @strings;

push @strings, 'nospace';
push @strings, 'trailingspace      ';
push @strings, '      leadingspace';
push @strings, 'internal space';

for(@strings)
{
	print "Before: '$_'\n";
	s/\s*(.*?)\s*/$1/;
	print "After: '$_'\n\n\n";
}

Outputs:
Before: 'nospace'
After: 'nospace'


Before: 'trailingspace      '
After: 'trailingspace      '


Before: '      leadingspace'
After: 'leadingspace'


Before: 'internal space'
After: 'internal space'

Actually, I stole the foreach loop code directly from CGI::Cookies' raw_fetch sub.

Since the target server doesn't have Apache::Cookie installed, and the stock 5.6.1 CGI::Cookie is borked under mod_perl, I just ripped the code to make it slim.

Seems to work as intended.

On the formatting side, I'm thinking about revamping the layout again so we can use 100% of the page width in code samples.

I was shocked... *shocked* to find such a regex in CGI::Cookie.  So, just to make sure I was not going crazy, I conferred with my monkish brethren (http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=299587).  That regex is, indeed, broken.  I am submitting  a patch.  Just goes to show, even the better programmers slip up time-to-time.

Yes, it would; but it is doing too much.  On the first part, why match on 0 spaces?  On the end, why match on 0 spaces?  At the very least, change those to + signs a la: s/^\s+(\S.*?)\s+$/$1/;.  Even then, why match 1 or more spaces, then match on a non-space?  Of course that is going to happen or the regex will fail in the case of all spaces.  Basically, the idiomatic perl way to strip leading and trailing spaces is for(@array) { s/^\s+//, s/\s+$// }

P.S.  It's hard to make comments legible without 'br' and 'p' tags, at least.

Actually, I don't know how legit it is to do so, but I cheat even further: s/(^\s+|\s+$)/.

And yes, I hear the pleas for comment sanity.
Due to how this site is built (AxKit/XML/XSLT) I can't just turn on HTML in comments without some major breakage.

As soon as I get a handle on DocBook, I'm going to start converting the site to it, widen the page widths and allow xhtml in comments to better deal with the display of code and such.

Considering the house purchase, I don't see it happening soon.

I'm working on a multi-lingual site problem for a friend of sorts. The basic problem was how to get Apache MultiViews to remember your language preference regardless of what your browsers Accept-Language header is set to without having to alter any browser configurations. Of course you could hack some scripts and links to do the same using a redirector page, but this way the href links remain clean and simple.
</p>
<p>
With a little bit of <a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/downloads/AcceptLanguage.pm">PerlInitHandler goodness</a> and some javascript, all is well.
</p>
<p>
Take a tinker with <a href="http://tinderbox.icantfocus.com/">the mock site</a>.
</p>
<p>
P.S.. Yes. "Tinderbox" isn't too original of a host name, but I find it funny in a code-burst-into-flames sort of way. :-)
</p>
<p>
P.S.S. I'm a loser. It really does validate. :-)

Anyone out there using the Eclipse IDE know how to tell it what encoding to save a file as? I almost always write my perl files and xml in UTF-8, but saving new files sometimes yields me a file saved in ANSI. Ick. It almost seems like a plug-in specific thing. I sure wish I could tell it to always create UTF-8. Kinda sucks having to create the files in something else first.

Just some mild tinkering today on converting and existing ASP site to <acronym title="FreeBSD, Apache, ModPerl">FAMP</acronym>. Of course, I'm trying to be a good boy and write my tests first. Is it really as hard as it seams?
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, I feel dirty, like I'm doing something wrong by having to Test::MockObject everything just to test one module by itself. It feels like a whole lot of work just to test one module. Is there a point where you should stop mocking objects? To test one module, should you only mock your sibling modules in the same package, but use the real live 3rd party modules instead of mocking them too? Mocking DBI. Mocking Error. Mocking Local::MakeText. I think the TDD process is mocking me. :-/
</p>
<p>
Wow. Most of an afternoon mocking a Cart::add sub to verify it Does The Right Thing when you send a quantity &lt; 0 or something non numeric, or forget to send a sku. Creating similiar tests between standalone module testing and integrated testing with Error and  exceptions running for real. I'm sure it will pay off in the futre. When? Grrrr.

So the mortgage company called Friday, and I returned their call this morning.
Apparently in our post 9/11 stupidity, all parties giving "Gift money", which Margeaux did to me, must have their SS# run through the terrorist checks (whatever the hell those are). How fucking retarded.
</p>
<p>
For the purposes of buying a house, there are only 2 people who can give you gift money: blood relative and your fiance. What a time to find our your s.o. is a terrorist. Even more idiotic is the fact that we're talking about <strong>$4,000</strong>. That's right <strong>four thousand dollars</strong>.  They would run the same "check" if it were $25.
</p>
<p>
If were going to accept money from a terrorist, it sure as shit would be a whole lot more than $4000; more like $1,000,000.  Just another waste of taxpayer money at work.
</p>
<p>
What's scary about that is the fact that people have already been barred from airlines because some jackass hit the wrong key and  flagged some 7th gen Iowa farmers as "terrorists". Can you imagine finding out you can't close on your new house because some dipshit made the same kind of mistake?

<p>
I finally decided to get back to work on my commerce site conversion from ASP to mod_perl. Almost right away, I decided that using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Class%3A%3ADBI&amp;mode=module">Class::DBI </a> was not only sane, but a real time saver. The last thing I want to do is spend my time writing data layer calls and code.
</p>
<p>
After re-reading the <a href="http://www.perl.com/search/index.ncsp?sp-q=Class%22%22DBI&amp;submit=Search">articles on Perl.com</a> and trading some emails with Tony Bowden about Class::DBI, I've come to the acceptance (with his helpful suggestion) that they way most of us ecom people do shopping carts is wrong from a database schema perspective.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following schema:
</p>
<ul>
<li>cart
<ul>
<li>item_id</li>
<li>shopper_id</li>
<li>sku</li>
<li>quantity</li>
<li>price</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
From the perspective of mapping objects to database data, we have a cart table containing cart item rows. This could be mapped to a Cart object that contains a collection of Cart Items. Sounds good, until I started using Class::DBI.
</p>
<p>
Once I created a Cart object, and mapped it to the cart table, it was clear to me that Class::DBI would return individual Cart objects, not Cart::Item objects. Sure, I can rename the base cart class Cart::Item instead, but symantically, it doesn't fit. A Cart Item object should be creating new cart item objects, nor loading the entire cart contents. This issue is made more true if I wanted to save or label shopping carts and their contents.
</p>
<p>
What to do? Do what I should've always done, but never did out of habit: make a cart table and a cart_items table.
</p>


<ul>
<li>cart
<ul>
<li>cart_id</li>
<li>shopper_id</li>
<li>cart_type</li>
<li>name</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>cart_items
<ul>
<li>item_id</li>
<li>cart_id</li>
<li>sku</li>
<li>quantity</li>
<li>price</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Not only does this make more sense, it also means that Class::DBI will yield more sane objects via the <code>has_many</code> method.
</p>

<p>
Now, on to my second cart issue: <code>item_id</code>.
</p>
<p>
I've seen many a shopping cart tables where the item_id , or the row identifier for shopping cart items are AUTO_INCRIMENT integers. This drives me nutty. It's a built in limitation. As some point in the future, the number of items added will reach it's maximum number allow for the integer type, then kaboom. Why build in that limitation?
</p>
<p>
Personally, I always use unique identifiers (UUID) for each item id instead of integers. Of course, I could be smoking crack.

Well, Murphy bit my ass hard today. I upgraded a server from NT4 to W2K and all hell broke loose. In a nutshell, all my COM+ components STOPPED firing their <samp>ObjectControl_Deactivate</samp> events completely. No deactivate events = no object cleanup. No object cleanup = shit breaks.
</p>
<p>
After a day of debugging this shit, come to find out that having this in your ASP page:
</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;@ Language=VbScript Transaction=Not_Supported&gt;
</code>
</p>
<p>
causes the <samp>ObjectControl_Deactivate</samp> event to be completely shit canned.
To make matters worse, <samp>Transaction</samp> has for possibilities: <samp>Required</samp>, <samp>Requires_New</samp>, <samp>Supported</samp>, and <samp>Not_Supported</samp>. Using ANY of them in your ASP page on W2K/IIS5 causes <samp>Deactivate</samp> to never fire. Now, remove the <samp>Transaction</samp> attribute entirely:
</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;@ Language=VbScript&gt;
</code>
</p>
<p>
brings the <samp>Deactivate</samp> event back to life. This is the case even if the page AND the component are set to the same thing.
</p>
<p>
How fucking retarded is that? What could the default of <samp>Transaction</samp> be if it's not <samp>Required</samp>, <samp>Requires_New</samp>, <samp>Supported</samp>, and <samp>Not_Supported</samp>? Funking retards.
</p>
<p>
With that informaiton, reflect on the fact that <samp>ObjectControl_Deactivate</samp> fires 100% of the time under NT4/IIS4. Grrrr.
</p>
<p>
I'm sure .NET and one degree of separation would fix this. :-/

The price wasn't too bad all things considered. 
I went with the Toshiba because the price was good, and I here the wireless config is a lot more flexable than most of the IPAQs.  We'll see.

Now here's the sad part. The first thing I want to do with it? Use it to build and test "handheld" stylesheets for the website. Go figure.

Well, we went to Lowes to look for a washer, maybe a dryer. The new house doesn't have a washer, and we're going to want to do laundry next week. <strong>We move in next week!!!!</strong>
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, we picked the perfect night to go. It was the last night of a 12 Months Same As deal for all Energy Start appliances. So, we snagged a25 cubit foot KitchenAide Stainless Steel side by side fridge, and a Maytag 3.3 cubic ft.  washer and it's sister dryer. All for $3200. Ouch. But, we have no payments or interest for 12 months. Plenty of time to sell the old place and pay off the card.
</p>
<p>
Plus, for anything over $3000, our interest rate went from 21% to 13%. Not bad, not that I plan on having to find out first hand.
</p>
<p>
Even better, they have and can deliver all of them on Tuesday while I'm waiting on Dish Networks to move my dish service.

Larry of Roanoke VA (12/15/03): 
Lowe's, through their credit card, offers no-interest promotional purchases from time to time. The problem is, Monogram Bank makes it very difficult to pay these off. When they receive your payment, they apportion it to the regular balance as well as any promotional purchases. It took us months to get them to properly apply our payments to promotional purchases so we could avoid the interest. Additionally, the monthly statement is very difficult to decipher. We will never use this credit card again!

Darlene of Leesburg VA writes (6/4/02): 
In October 2001, my fiance and I bought a new home. We decided to open separate Lowe's accounts (his limit was $250, mine was $300) to buy a washer and dryer. We purchased these and were given 6 months of "no payments". My first payment of $15 is due on June 19, 2002. 

On June 3, 2002, I received a letter from the Monogram Bank of Georgia stating that my account had been closed due to my credit score changing. I called and asked how they could cancel my account when I had done nothing wrong and my first payment wasn't even due yet. They stated that because I bought a home, my credit score dropped so after a review of my credit they decided to close my account. I argued that nothing had changed since I was approved by Lowe's. I was approved AFTER I had bought the home so they knew of this purchase BEFORE they approved me.

Now my credit will be adversely affected because they closed my account. How is it possible that they can close my account when I don't have bad credit with them? I am in perfect standing with them. Based on a "credit review", they are making a judgement about me that has nothing to do with my account with them. They also closed my fiance's account 2 months after he opened it for the same reason.

Ed of Lenoir City, TN (4/17/02): 
Lowes Credit Card issued 4/25/01 (later I found out it was issued by Monogram Bank Of Georgia) with a creit limit of $1500. Purchased refrigerator for about $1300 on a no-payments, no-interest basis until Jan 2002. Fine print says 6 months but promo was Jan 2002. In Nov 2001 I refinanced and paid off Sears, Pennys, Home Depot, and 3 credit cards totalling about $5000-$6000. Obviously, my credit score should have improved (had no delinquencies on any accounts and making monthly payments to Lowes).

In December I get a letter from Monogram Bank stating after reviewing my account they were lowering my credit limit to $500. My balance at the time was about $1250 because I had made some small purchases and I was making $20 monthly payments at the time. Now I find out that the credit bureaus show my Lowe's account as over the limit when I did nothing to cause this. Main office customer service denied this until I faxed a copy of my Eqifax credit report and then the response was there was nothing they could do that the decision was based on my credit file which, as I stated earlier, should have been better at this time than when the account was first opened.

Lowes only rules if you can drive out of the store with the item.

I tried to order it on line.  Than I found out that on-line orders mean they send a little post-it note to the stores where it promptly gets lost.  And the order number their confirming email sent me means absolutely nothing to the Lowes store clerk.

And when they finally say they'll deliver sometime between 12 and 4, it means they still haven't found the order yet, but wait at home all day for nothing please.  And oh yeah, good luck getting your money back or a delivery.

We have DSL in the new house finally!!!!!!!!!!! It only took 3 phone calls and 2 incorrect self-install kits, but it's up and working. Now, time to figure out how and when to move DNs and the servers.

Well, in theory, everything thing is moved and DNS should be propogated quite nicely by now. The only hitch so far is the damn router that came with the DSL. It's a Cayman 3546. Not a bad router, but it's NAT suffers from one caveat I hate: I can't access internal servers via their external IP address. I used to be able to do this on my old router (Efficient 5861) just fine.
</p>
<p>
Oh well. Time to upgrade to Bind9 and use the view to send different records for my domains for internal and external clients.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Linksys USB Wireless products are fucking horrible when combined with XP and it's "Zero Configuration".
</p>
<p>
I have no less than (2) WUSB11 v2.6 USB units and (2) WPC11 v2.5 PCMCIA units; all running under XP. Not one of those products installed correctly, or ran correctly even after triple checking all wireless and network parameters. All of them have require constant hakcing during installation and setup to get them on the network, with or without Zero Config disabled.
</p>
<p>
I just spend an hour installing a WUSB11 on XP pro. Install. Missing Parameters in hardware config. Reinstall. Setup WAP profile. No conneciton. Deinstall. Reinstall.  Deinstall. Reinstall. WEP parameters in hardware manager now show up.  Can connection with Zero Config disabled and hardware properties set. Can't connect with Linksys monitor/config utility. <strong>#$%$#@</strong>
Hey the hell do NON computer techies deal with it all? Oh yeah, they leave WEP off and SSID browdcasts on. :-/
</p>
<p>
Next time, I'm going with DLink.
</p>
<p>
<ins>
Oh, and have I mentioned that one WUSB11 drops packets like no tomorow?
Time to try the PCI NIC. After that, I'm gonna find a way to run Cat5.

I must say, I've never tried 3Com. The ONLY problem I've ever had w/3Com was some old drivers freakin out with a 3C509 and a 3C509-TX in the same box. Other the years, their 3C509 cards have always been my first choice regardless of price.

I snagged a Linksys WMP11 PCI adapter and so far, it's been rock solid compared to the WUSB11 junk.

I'm having the same problem configuring a WUSB11 ver. 2.5. How did you get it to work with WEP? I'm missing tabs in the config utility (Connection and Encryption).
Hope to hear from you... :O/

Well, after much head bashing I purchased a WMP11 PCI wireless NIC. Yet my network availability problems persisted, even after installing my signal booster just for giggles.
</p>
<p>
Luckily some kind aware soul pointed out the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=826942">Microsoft Wireless Update Rollup Package</a>. Of course, it's not part of the usual Windows Update process. :-)  It seems to have solved my problem. But now I'm pissed even more...why just this computer and not the PCMCIA cards on the laptops? Grrrr. Fargin wireless.

Well, for anyone reading, you've no doubt already seen my rants about horrible inconsistant Linksys Wireless hardware. Well I took some advice and ignore my Microsoft bashing for a moment, and purchased a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/broadbandnetworking/productdetails.aspx?pid=006">Microsoft MN-730 Wireless-G NIC</a>.
</p>
<p>
When I first learned that Microsoft was going to sell wireless hardware, I laughed. I figured it would be horrible, and indeed the first round of things looked to be a bit rough. But I must say, this card and it's drivers have been <strong>ROCK SOLID</strong> where the Linksys simply crapped on itself over and over.  If I ever convert to WPA and full 802.11g 54Mbps, I might just stick with MS wireless hardware (NIC/PCMCIA). 
</p>
<p>
Since I only need a WAP, and not a router, I probably won't get the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/broadbandnetworking/productdetails.aspx?pid=002">MN-700</a>. Then again, some of the Router/PCMCIA card package deals are pretty good.

Rumor has it that these cards use the Broadcom chipset. So, depending on the support level in Linux/*BSD for Broadcom wireless chipsets, I think it should work.

Another reason not to get MN-700 is the fact that you can't do bridging with it. In theory it should work but the two units I have tried caused severe network problems. I spent maybe 3 hours debugging the network only to find that the routers were to blame.

I have the g router from MS and was suprised to find that all of the networking issues with Longhorn have not affected it. Right out of the box I had connectivity, granted it was the wired part. But considering the issues others had I didn't really expect it to connect without tweaking it.

As I'm sure Margeaux and others can testify, I've been extremely up tight, ready to explode lately. The cats don't get along. Two houses. Two sets of bills. Computer wireless not working right. I've been ready to burst for a while now. Yes, I realize there are others with far less with far worse problems. I'm lucky and I shouldn't be complaining.
</p>
<p>
For some reason once I finally got the computer upstairs and working from the other house, I'm finally started to listen to my <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000078/">Delphi SKYFi</a> that Margeaux got me more often. Not only that, but I've been listening to the Classical stations. I'd forgotten how much I really like that music after I graduated music school.  Maybe it's the highly complex math and patterns behind it all. But I digress.
</p>
<p>
Listening to Mozart and Beethoven (Music by Dead Guys as we would say in collage) has chilled me out somewhat. That and a few good doses of Dave Brubeck Quartets' Take Five and Blue Rondo A La Turk seem to have gotten me a little more centered again. <ins>Now we're onto Tito Puente.</ins>

After her WPC11 Linksys Wireless-B card started freaking (actually, I think it's really her OS is fubared), I purchased an Microsoft MN-820 Wireless Notebook package. It's the Wireless Notebook kit with the MN-700 router and the MN-720 PCMCIA card.

It has definately been a case of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly so far this evening. I plan on spewing forth a long review of the pros and cons of this hardware tomorrow once I awaken from my slumber.

On the upshot, it was $127, and there's another $30 MS rebate after that.

True. For me at least, the MN-730 PCI cards have been way more consistant than the Linksys crap. And the MN-700's signal is just as good as my Linksys WAP11 WITH a signal booster on it.

Personally, I'm starting to think that on a whole, 99% of all wireless right now is complete junk unless you're buying high end (aka, non-best-buy-compusa-circuit-city models).

Here would be the Microsoft MN-700 review had I not taken it back for a refund. Let's just say it didn't really work in Access Point mode past reboot it after every card connects for the first time via DHCP. More on that later when I calm down a bit.

	Now that I've had some time to calm down a bit and reflect on my past wireless grievances,
	I figured I would air my wireless experience  with all who would read it in hopes that
	someone else can save themselves many hours of hair pulling and constant bouts of
	Tourette's syndrome.
</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<h2><a name="beginning">In The Beginning</a></h2>
<p>
	What started my wireless journey was moving into the new house. The old place had 100Mbit wired
	to the first floor where I had one lone Linksys WAP11 v2.2 wireless-b access point. I also had
	two Linksys WPC11 wireless-b PCMCIA cards for the laptops and one Linksys WUSB11.USB adapter for
	the computer on the second floor. For the most part, everything worked
	rather well from the living room to the office where the AP was located. The USB adapter on the second
	floor was a little flaky. Sometimes it would just lose connection for no apparent reason, even though
	it's signal strength and signal quality were both close to 100%.
</p>
<p class="image">
	<img src="/blog/images/hardware/wap11.jpg" alt="Linksys WAP11" />
	<img src="/blog/images/hardware/wpc11.jpg" alt="Linksys WPC11" />
	<img src="/blog/images/hardware/wusb11.jpg" alt="Linksys WUSB11" />
</p>
<p>
	After that, my only real problems 
	were the usual Linksys firmware issues where one problem was fixed and others were created. For a long time
	I ran a 1.0g version just so I can turn SSID broadcasts off and actually have all the wireless cards
	connect. Imagine that, turn of SSID broadcast and Linksys cards won't connect to their own Linksys AP. Nice.
	Just before I moved, I made the mistake of checking the Linksys site and finding that the latest version
	of the firmware was 1.1, so I upgraded. This was probably the start of my problems.
</p>
<h2><a name="move">The Move</a></h2>
<p>
	After the move I stuck the servers and the WAP11 in the basement. The laptops are wireless and usually on the first floor 
	and her desktop was wireless and on the second floor. I however was hardwired at the old house, 
	so I had to get my computer online wirelessly. I first opted for getting another Linksys WUSB11 USB wireless-b adapter.
	This inevitably led to another evening of fighting with Windows Zero Configuration, the drivers, and the Linksys installer.
	On installed, everything appeared to be somewhat fine. Then the headaches started.
</p>
<p class="image">
	<img src="/blog/images/hardware/wusb11.jpg" alt="Linksys WUSB11" />
</p>
<p>
	After about a day or so of actual usage, the connection started dropping at random. Sometimes the signal would be 
	at 100% (Excellent) then jump down to Low, then back up again. Then it would be fine for hours; then random drops again.
	During this time, the laptop right next to me would be solid and connected without any problems. No microwaves running.
	Not to many 2.4Ghz phones setup yet. Aluminum siding, so that should keep out most unwanted signals. After some Googling,
	it looked like the WUSB adapters were just junk for the most part.
</p>
<p>
	So, of to the evil Best Buy I went to snag a Linksys (now referred to as Limpsys) WMP11 PCI Wireless-B adapter.
</p>
<p class="image">
	<img src="/blog/images/hardware/wmp11.jpg" alt="Linksys WMP11" />
</p>
<p>
	I installed the WMP11. This meant yet another round of fighting the install, the drivers, and Wireless Zero Config.
	The connection strength and signal quality was still strong. The connection seemed more stable at first, but after
	another 3 days of troubleshooting, I still had random connection drops. And like before, the laptop right beside me would be rock solid.
	Grrrrr.
</p>
<p>
	Taking a chance I installed the Linksys WSB24 Signal Booster that I had snagged a month earlier in anticipation of having wireless in 
	the basement and computers on the second floor.
</p>
<p class="image">
	<img src="/blog/images/hardware/wsb24.jpg" alt="Linksys WSB24 Signal Booster" />
</p>
<p>
	While this helped strengthen my signal and made it more consistent from a signal strength standpoint, the random disconnects 
	persisted for both computers upstairs.
</p>

<p>
	After surfing the <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/">Broadband Reports</a> wireless and Linksys forums, more than once I was given the advice to give the Microsoft
	wireless products a try. I'll be honest, when I first heard that Microsoft was going to do wireless, I figured it was going to be junk.
	The first gen products indeed were rumored to be less than stellar. I was reluctant to buy anything MS related for wireless hardware, but after a few more
	words from people who already had Linksys problems then tried MS, I gave in.
</p>
<p>
	So once again we head towards the evil Best Buy. I returned the Limpsys WMP11 PCI card and picked up the Microsoft MN-730.
</p>
<p class="image">
	<img src="/blog/images/hardware/mn730.jpg" alt="Microsoft MN-730" />
</p>
<p>
	I installed the software and then the card. The first problem I had was with the software "wizard" that tried to
	guide me though the setup of the PCI card. While if gives me options of choosing whether I do or don't have a access point and whether
	it is or isn't the MN-700, it in no way shape or form gave my the option to enter my WAP details. It just assumed I have SSID broadcasts turned on and
	am running an open network. So I hit Cancel and proceeded to do the manual card setup. Once that was done and I was connected, my random disconnects appeared to stop. <strong>Score!</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The MN-730 card was way more consistent than the Limpsys stuff I've tried thus far. So much so that I purchased a second card for her desktop
	computer. Score one for Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
	Now, up to this point, I was pretty aggravated to say the least. Since I do the computer thing for a living, I don't like losing
	the battle when it comes to things not working. So I was pretty happy that the solution seems to be at hand.
</p>


<h2><a name="murphy">Hello St. Murphy</a></h2>
<p>
	In true St. Murphy style, her Linksys WPC11 PCMCIA card stopped working. It just wouldn't connect at all.
	Even if I put the card in my laptop, it still wouldn't connect. <strong>#$%@#</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	After fighting yet another piece of Linksys hardware, I decided to give the Microsoft MN-720 a try.
	The local Circuit City had the MN-820 Wireless Notebook Kit on sale for $129.00 and it also had a $30 mail-in rebate.
	A damn good deal I thought at the time, and since I needed the PCMCIA adapter and almost had all wireless-g adapters, a wireless-g access point (router) wouldn't suck for the extra $30 bucks 
	above the cost of the PCMCIA card alone.
</p>
<p class="image">
	<img src="/blog/images/hardware/mn820.jpg" alt="Microsoft MN-820 Wireless Kit" />
</p>
<p>
	First I installed the MN-700 base station. Nothing too special. It has an Access Point mode in which the routing is turned off, the WAN port is disabled, and
	it becomes a client on your network. The first downside was that in AP mode, it expects to get an IP address via DHCP from your network. But I don't have DHCP on my LAN. :-(
	But that would be the least of my problems it seems.
</p>
<p>
	After finishing the WPA config, changing the password, changing the SSID, turning off SSID broadcasts and putting the unit in AP mode, I installed the MN0720 PCMCIA adapter.
	This time though, I didn't bother with the setup wizard since it wouldn't work with broadcasts disabled.
</p>
<p>
	Once I was up and running on the laptop, I went upstairs to repoint my desktop to the new AP. When that worked, I went back downstairs. The laptop stopped working. :-(
	Running <kbd>arp -a</kbd> showed no arp entried at all, not even the router. No amount of rebooting or restarting the network card would fix this. Damnit. So I rebooted the MN-700
	and tried again. When the laptop started working I went back upstairs. This time, that machine stopped working. Again, <kbd>arp -a</kbd> showed no entried. Nothing would fix it. And Yes, they
	had different IP addresses! :-)
</p>
<p>
	At this point, I'll admit that my LAN is slightly more complicated than the norm. I'm running the usual private space of 192.168.0.0/16. While I'm running it as a B class space, the
	damn MN-700 only supports 192.168.0.0/24, or a class C. You can't change the subnet mask on that unit. :-/
</p>
<p>
	At this point, I decided to meet my MN-700 half way. I spent the better part of the afternoon that day implementing DHCP, and compacting my various 192.168.x blocks into a single
	192.168.0.0/24 C class IP space. Now, time to try again..
</p>
<p>
	Upon booting the MN-700, it now picked up an IP address so I could actually admin the damn thing. And now that the MN-700 and my LAN are playing on the same IP block size, time to give it another whirl.
	Yet again, the computers would stopped receiving ARP broadcasts and no DHCP would be received. After some tinkering, I finally came up with the pattern.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Reboot MN-700</li>
	<li>Connect any computer to MN-700 - DHCP and ARP works.</li>
	<li>Right-Click->Disable Wireless Network Card</li>
	<li>Right-Click->Enable Wireless Network Card</li>
	<li>DHCP and ARP broken</li>
</ol>
<p>
...or...
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Reboot MN-700</li>
	<li>Connect any computer to MN-700 - DHCP and ARP works.</li>
	<li>Reboot</li>
	<li>DHCP and ARP broken</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This happened on any computer in the place. When the laptop would fail, I could insert my old card pointed to the WAP11 and everything worked dandy.
	
	When it was connected the 54Mbps speed was nice though! :-)
	The make matters worse, when the DHCP and ARP would fail after the second	
</p>
<p>
	So, back to Circuit City I went to return the obviously pissy MN-700. For $0.01 less, I snagged two MN-720 PCMCIA cards.
	Once I got those installed, everyone was happy again. The laptops worked. The desktops worked. No random drops or disconnects...
	
</p>
<p>
	Until Sunday. :-(  After looking around, I noticed that the WAP11 had rebooted on it's own. This appears to be a know, yet unfixed problem with the WAP11 v2.2 using the 1.1 firmware.
	Luckily, someone on the forums mentioned that they had the same problem, and the Limpsys FTP server had v1.1a firmware. Unsupported. Unofficial, yet my WAP hasn't rebooted on it's own since.
</p>

<h3>What I've learned</h3>
<p>
	Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm convinced that consumer wireless products as a whole are complete junk and a quality crap shoot. I truly believe that 
	the Microsoft wireless adapter cards are much better than the Linksys cards. I'm convinced that the MN-700 is junk. And I'm convinced that I spent way to much time 
	trying to get something as "simple" was plug-n-pray wireless working.
</p>
<p>
	While I'm no expert, I'm not an idiot when it comes to computers. It's how I pay the bills. I guess being a techie makes dealing with this crap even more frustrating.
	Lord knows how Joe Consumer does it.
</p>
<p>
I'm considering upgrading to the Linksys WAP54G just to make use of all the wireless-g cards in the house. But then again, no telling how much worse that will make things. Rumour has it that the WSB24 Signal Booster will work on the WAP54G, unofficially of course.

Well some good news for me is that you got the two mn700s to talk to each other.  I have been trying to set one of my mn700's to access point mode to hook up to my xbox's in the living room.  The ap never gets the ip from the wireless dhcp router.  I read the usenet and saw a few times that this could not be done.  Do you have any pointers for me?  Both have the latest firmware according to the software microshaft made me install to get the updates.

My objective was to move my desktop to another room without having to run ethernet cable.
Installed MS MN-730 with a DLink 731P router following package instructions - no problem.  MN-730 couldn't router.  Rebooted cable modem - problem solved.  Now, however, internet response time is horrible, only a fraction of the response time I was getting from my straight Ethernet connection, and thus unacceptable (even though the system says the MN-730 is running at 11mps to my router).
Anybody know why this happened, or how to fix it?

By the way, my Netgear and Linksys cards in my laptops work great using the same router.

Thanks for sharing, Chris.  I also do the computer thing for a living.  In anticipation of getting cable Internet at home later this year (thanks for nothing, Verizon!), I picked up an MN-700 (for $60, yet!) at my nearby Target store.  When I revealed this event to my boss, he threw a possibly flaky Netgear WAB501 my way so that I can test it.  I've been itching to get home early enough to find out how nice it is to sync offline files from halfway across the house.  "Watching" your "movie" here has opened my eyes; if I have to troubleshoot, I'll do it swiftly and without mercy in order to save myself the grief.

Well, I bought one of the MN-700's today.  Got it for $49 by itself, which was cheaper than the LinkSys 802.11b router on the same shelf!

I got it home, set it up as a base station and it Just Worked.  Curious to see if there was a firmware update (I am anal about BIOS, firmware and driver updates!), I found one.  I downloaded the updater, updated the unit, and then rebooted it.  When I logged back in, it had retained all of my settings (as it should have) and had indeed updated the firmware.

I have yet to experience any problems with the router -- the wired and wireless portions work flawlessly.

I used to work for Microsoft and have actually worked in the hardware group. The General Manager wanders around looking lost most of the time and organizes fantasy football pools. Quite a few of the program managers have an IQ slightly above a rock and lesser than an earth worm. The place is a sorry excuse for a loser lifestyle.

Now that having been said - The MN700 impressed me with its ability. The honeymoon vanished when 10 minutes later after ascertaining the router abilities of the dang thingy I switched it to AP mode. It cannot acquire an IP from the router, if I present it a friggin' ip from a locked "pool" give it the subnet and point it to the router it still does not work. Tell me - if this sad arse group did not have the shielding of Microsoft would they have survived a minute in the marketplace ?

I have a WMP11 card in one of my PCs, and I too get the random disconnects, but I've come to notice it's not so random after all - it seems to disconnect after a certain amount of data has passed through it - I can reliably and consistently kill it by trying to copy a CD image across it. I haven't figured out exactly what byte count kill it yet, but it seems to be somewhere around 400-500 megs. Regular usage will kill it after a couple of days. Heavy network file ops will do it in a matter of hours. 

At least with SP2, it's a simple matter of "repairing" the connection, which disconnects, reconnects, reassociates, and then renews the IP address. Kills your file transfer, though.

Apparently the karma bin is running close to empty this week. On Sunday right after some closure to my wireless saga, one of my teeth in the bottom front shed a chunk out of the corner for no reason (actually, the reason was two teeth pressing in toward each other for a long time).
</p>
<p>
Then  this week, grandma broke her arm. As unlucky as that is, it's better than a leg or hip. Some pain meds and therapy and she'll be ok.
</p>
<p>
We started painting, scrapiing, spackling and cleaning the old house in preperation for sale. So much to fix. The wallpaper did come off really easy though, which irks me a bit. If I knew if was going to be that east (because it was old a cheap) I would've done it a long time ago. Plus, almost all of the floors have hardwood underneath. At least there won't be much if any carpet replacement.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, I heard a crash this morning while Margo was getting ready for work.  Apparently the 6' closet hanger (<a href="http://www.closetmaid.com/closet/">ClosetMaid</a>) pull out from the driywall and came crashing to the floor. Great, more drywall holes to fill. What really pisses me off is the fact that the installers (house contracters when it was built) didn't even try to hit any studs whatsoever. Smart move for something that you'll hang many clothes from. Tards.
</p>
<p>
So guess what I get to do tonight? That's right, hand a new pole  and fill the holes. At least I've got a <a href="http://www.blackanddecker.com/ProductGuide/ProductDetail.aspx?PID=5550">kick ass stud finder</a> and leveler.
</p>
<p>
Lord knows what tomorrow may hold. I can't wait until next year when I can use vacation for actual vacation.

After my <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000406/">Wireless saga</a> I decided to snag a Linksys WAP54G for X-mas.
</p>
<p class="image">
<img src="/blog/images/hardware/wap54g.jpg" alt="Linksys WAP54G" />
</p>
<p>
After a setting up the access point and repointing part of the computers to use it, I started getting the following errors in the event logs about 5 minutes after the machines boots. once the error hits, no IP traffic goes through.
</p>
<p>
<cite>
Your computer was not able to renew its address from the network (from the DHCP Server) for the Network Card with network address 000D3A22383D. The following error occurred:
The semaphore timeout period has expired. . Your computer will continue to try and obtain an address on its own from the network address (DHCP) server.
</cite>
</p>
<p>
After a Disable and re Enable of the wireless card, everything works fine. Go figure. After searching the newsgroups and Broadband Reports, I've come to the conclusion that Windows XP, Zero Wireless Config, WPA (or WEP w/801.2x auth) and SHCP are simply and completely broken. 
</p>
<p>
My MN-700 router also failed DHCP unser WPA. If almost all XP users have the 801.2x box checked inder WEP, that too failes with DHCP/connection strangeness. 
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, if I set the WAP54G back to use WEP 128 and make sure the 801.2x auth box is unchecked, everything moves along with now problems.
</p>
<p>
Sure, I have not the time to come up with something scientific, but do a Google search for wireless, 801.2x, dropped connections, XP, and you'll see what I mean. Here's hoping that this crap gets fixed in XPSP2.

Hello I have recently upgraded my WRT54G to the latest firmware 2.02.2 and I am starting to get the "The semaphore timeout period has expired. . Your computer will continue to try and obtain an address on its own from the network address (DHCP) server" error's on my laptop.  I have WAP-PSK (TKIP) enabled.  I have used this router for about 20 days on the orginal firmware; 2.00.8

I am going to reflash the unit with the previous firmware and if that cures the problem I will just be left out until a firmware is issued to correct this issue.

I've just resorted to switching back to WEP 128 bit from WPA-PSK.  I've narrowed it down to the fact that the 801.2xx authentication option is automatically ticked (checked) with WPA and is also disabled, so that the user is unable to amend it.

Since the authentication is only ever of use if you have a RADIUS server or some other certification server sitting out there, it times out attempting to authenticate and therefore will not obtain a DHCP lease.  

My original solution was to manually kick it into action by forcing it to look for the router or restarting the router.

The question is whether the fault lies with Windows and it's setup for wireless authentication or Linksys drivers?

One of the reasons that I haven't purchased an XBox yet is that it doesn't solve

</p>

Here's what I want to the next gen game device. The first person to come up with

graphics that every gamer expects, it's about time we have the wireless emersion
experience in gaming. We have the tech for it.
</p>
<p>
Give me wireless goggles, wireless gloves, a wireless fake shooting device (ala
pump shotgun) and wireless boots devices that can track whether I'm running or
walking or kicking. That way I can <strong>STAND</strong> in the middle of the
room, and interact with my favorite First Person Shooter and get exercise at
the same time. I'm sure we have the tech to put sensors in things, or even just
attach then to shoes and gloves. Nothing fancy.

And none of the whining from the "video games cause violence" camp about the
mock shooting device. I'm an adult. Games don't cause violence. Parent your

Last October my Comcrap  lappy died and I was forced to purchase another lappy.
I stumbled upon Alienware laptops, which have tons more horsepower than standard laptops at the time, but their price was nasty. I then learned of <a href="http://www.sagernotebook.com/">Sager notebooks</a> which were the same hardware without the overpriced paint jobs. Then I read some reviews and found a great reseller: <a href="http://www.powernotebooks.com/">PowerNotebooks.com</a> from which to purchase my <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000039/">Sager 5660</a>. Their service and staff were awesome compared to everything I've experienced in the past from BigCos.
</p>
<p>
Well, they've done it again. Today, albeit a little late, I receive the 2004 calander/photo/holiday card from the staff at PowereNotebooks.

It's an easy list. It's what drives me. It's what makes me hate my job far to often. And it's something I'll probably never get: closure; completion; sense of accomplishment; satisfaction in a program; pride of it's quality.
</p>
<p>
Seems like a simple list right? Some days I wonder. Just once in my life, I want to come up with a decent requirements list and impliment a software project complete with documentation, proper unit and group testing, clean code, including query plan and index tuning for every query and procedure written. I'm not asking the world, for the love of all that is holy, can I please finish one thing properly before I die?
</p>
<p>
Program changes happen. Fine. Bugs happen. New features happen. Fine. But for the love of pete I'm so tired of skimping on documentation and proper testing because we have to many bright idea of the week projects, to many oh by the way projects and  to few people and can't prioritize long term decisions. (Our department does it fine much to the credit of my bosses. It's the rest of the company that doesn't want to play along.)

IE is retarded. The PRE tags have overflow: scroll set in CSS. Works great in Netscape/Safari/Mozilla. Of course, IE windows fails to scroll them, and IE on the Mac fails to show and content within at all. Time for some CSS hacks, or just not bother. Haven't decided.

Someone has <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/elastic/">finally figured out a way</a> to use the more flexibile <code>ems</code> for the CSS <code>font-size</code> property and have IE not display the smaller or smallest fonts in an insanely unreadable size.

Anyone out there using MovableType to serve up XML?
I need to output all user comments as sanitized XML w/converted line breaks.
</p>
<p>
So far, I can specify <code>encode_xml="1"</code>, but MT  wraps the content in a <code>&lt;![CDATA[ ]]&gt;</code>. block, which I don't want. I can also use <code>encode_html="1"</code> with <code>NoHTMLEntities=1</code> in the <code>mt.cfg</code>. No matter which I pick, if I also use <code>convert_breaks="1"</code>, the encoding options also encode the <code>p</code> and <code>br</code> tags put in by the <code>convert_breaks</code> tag. Grrrr.
</p>
<p>
All I really need is a convert breaks w/ an ampersand encoder.
</p>

<ins>
<p>
Rather than waste more time on the issue, I used <a href="http://mt-plugins.org/archives/entry/regex.php">Brad Choate's Regex plugin</a> to do the deed. Comments should now be formatted.

Someone help me out here. If I'm wrong, explain it to me in another way. Maybe I'm not explaining it clearly myself. But I really don't think I'm wrong.  I don't believe that after converting line feeds to BR tags and P container tags, that the result needs to have those tags encoded. The result is a valid piece of XML by itself.

OK, I think comments are fixed. As it turned out, I forgot the disable Sean Willsons rebuild patch in MT::App::Comments. Since I use it as mod_perl module instead of as a CGI, it can't rebuild the files after a new comment as it doesn't have permissions to. :-)

Boy am I really tired fighting MT on comments content.
Even after I disable ALL plugins, and turn off encoding, convertings, etc. MT STILL strips out a less than-text-greater than content even though it's NOT HTML tags:
</p>
<p>
This:
</p>
<pre>
<code>This is &lt; this and &gt; that.</code>
</pre>
<p>
becomes this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>This is that.</code>
</pre>
<p>
Yet another prime example of why to never use RegEx to filter out HTML.
I suspect this is the reason:
</p>
<pre>
<code>sub remove_html {
    my($text) = @_;
    $text =~ s!&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;!!gs;
    $text =~ s!&lt;!&amp;lt;!gs;
    $text;
}</code>
</pre>


<p>
All I want it to take a submitted comment, xml encode the CONTENT, not the tags, then add P and BR tags where appropriate. Apparently this is a tall order for multiple plugins.
</p>
<p>
Maybe it's time to roll my own using <samp>HTML::Tidy</samp> and some quick newline replacements.

Au contraire, there is *everything* wrong with using a regular expression to parse HTML:

We have differing definitions of "works really well," possibly.  

If you post your regex, I'll be more than happy to post HTML that is <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" rel="nofollow">valid</a> and will break your regex.  Parsing HTML is harder than people realize...

Shameless plus to <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl" rel="nofollow">PerlMonks </a> for all your regex (and non-regex issues like parsing) needs.

Man, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/01/14/thought_experiment">this is getting fun</a> to watch..er..<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001025">read</a>. To <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/feeddemon_and_w.html">accept  or reject</a> invalid markup; that is the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/11/PostelPilgrim">question</a>.
</p>
<p>
On of the nice things about having your site built upon an XML foundation (AxKit, XML, XSLT) is that I can't get away with missing or bogus tags as easilt as just writing XHTML in Textpad. But one thing's for sure, I'm all about being the W3C validator purist.
</p>
<p>
Is broken XML or XHTML, or even HTML4 really XML/XHTML/HTML4? No! So why be forgiving and read it, or try to. If a program says it can accept a test file, and you give it a PNG, should it try and render it anyways? Nope. That's why we're in the mess we are in now with IE, and all the other browser "Quirks" mode rendering. Don't bother calling it HTML if it isn't. Same goes for XML. IT either is or it isn't.
</p>
<ins>
<p>
My response elsewhere:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The whole reason we have XHTML(XML) is that it was impossible to parse/reuse HTML docs consistantly because they were unpredictable in structure due to every syntaz mistake under the sun being tolerated.
</p>
<p>
Now, if Atom, and RSS are indeed XML, then in no way shape or form should they be tolerated in any other form; i.e. non-validating XML. If they are, then we just lost the best feature of XML, and to some extent, XML as a standard: predictable parsibility.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Put on the flame suit boyz, it's gonna be a long one.

OK, so I got the itch to do something with my feeds, so I created a single <a href="/style/xsl/feeds.xsl">XSLT stylesheet</a>  to transform all of me feeds to something a little more friendly. My only beef with the stylsheet is that I have to specify <code>xsl:output method="html"</code> instead of <code>xsl:output method="xml"</code> because Mozilla Firebird would not render it as HTML. No big deal since I don't use and open HTML4 style tags. 
</p>
<p>Another nice Mozilla feature is that they don't serialize the final output, so <code>disable-output-escaping="yes"</code> doesn't work. This means all embeded HTML in the feed descriptions would be displayed, not rendered.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="http://www.feedvalidator.com/">feedvalidator.com</a>, all of my feeds are valid. Who knows if they're "funky" though. Lord knows how well this stylesheet will work with other peoples feeds. Give it a whirl. May the force be with you. YMMV.

<strong>Yes, I think this breaks RSS readers. Sorry folks. I've seen it done before. I guess it should use CSS stylesheets instead of XSL stylesheets. I'll fix it tomorrow night. I promise. :-)</strong>

Someone at work noticed that the new Safari under Pather, which now has Gzip support,  throws up an error after loading and displaying pages [correctly] on this site.
</p>
<p class="image">
<img src="/blog/images/www/safarierror.gif" alt="Safari Gzip Error" />
</p>
<p>
Supposedly, this is a "feature" in Safari when a server doesn't sent the <samp>Content-Length:</samp> header along with the gzipped content.  After chatting with the  AxKit mail list, this is fixed in the CVS tree. I've backported a patch and installed it. Since I don't have OSX or Safari, I'll have to check it tomorrow. 
</p>
<ins>
<p>
Confirmed. Adding <code>Content-Length:</code> cured the Safari problem.

OK, this time, I'll use the correct stylesheet type. :-) I've added a <a href="/style/css/feeds.css">CSS stylesheet</a> to all of my feeds at the top. It's two parts messy and 6 parts redundant with a touch of bloat. But it works.
</p>
<p>
 The first thing you'll notice is that everything looks great in Gecko based browser, and stupid in IE. The reason is simply that IE appears to be completely ignorant of the [draft or official?] 1999 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-namespace/">CSS <code>@namespace</code> extensions</a>. Shocking. 
</p>
<p>
This leads me to my other question. I know there was a big debate about custom namespaces in feeds and what is or isn't "funky". Is there any way to hide namespaced stuff in the feeds from IE by adding custom namespace elements ot attributes?

Hi there,

I searched a long time how to get my RDF-/RSS-Files correctly styled in IE.

They are correctly displayed in Opera and Mozilla, but IE just doesn't accept
any rules for tags that have an "rdf:" or "dc:" or any other namespace before them.

If you write:
RDF
{
  /* ... */
}
the &lt;rdf:RDF&gt;-Element is correctly styled in Mozilla and Opera but not in IE.

But if you write:
rdf\:RDF
{
  /* ... */
}
the &lt;rdf:RDF&gt;-Element is correctly styled in IE! Opera also understands that
workaround, but Mozilla doesn't. So you just write:
rdf\:RDF, RDF
{
  /* ... */
}
and everybody is happy. :-)

There should be no need for any "|"-Selector or any @namespace.

Hope that helps,
Alexander Koch

PS: Please excuse my bad English ;-)

<p>
<strong>This is a quick thought. I'll need to clean this post up a bit when I have more time.</strong>
</p>
<p>
After my <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000430/">tinkerage [and breaking]</a> of my feeds by applying XSL Stylesheets to them, I've come to the complusion 
that we need a new <code>@media</code> type for "feedreader", or "automated", or something else other than "screen".
</p>
<p>
The whole reason I wanted to use a client-side XSL stylesheet was to transform the highly-namespaced feeds into pure HTML, then apply a 
CSS stylesheet to the result; a sort of "pretty" version of an RSS feed when viewing it in a browser. This is even more important to use XSL to transform it into HTML considering how non-working IE is in terms of applying CSS stylesheets to namespaced XML.
What led me astray was the misconception that the XSL stylsheet would NOT be applied by feed readers. A silly misconception, but a valid one.
</p>
<p>
If I view the <em>whole</em> feed XML document in a browssr (or rendering engine), I would expect it to apply the xsl stylehseet. Fine.
But, if I only intend to download and parse the XML feed document, why apply the screen stylesheet?
Why does feedvalidators.com apply a screen XSL stylesheet and  fail to read and validate my feed when all it is supposed to do is parse and validate the contents of the primary XML feed file?
Don't get me wrong. I think it's Doing The Right thing. I just think that we need a way to specify that n automated reader should not parse external stylesheets.
</p>
<p>
Let's take this example:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="rss.xsl" type="text/xsl" media="screen"?&gt;
&lt;rss&gt;
    ...
&lt;/rss&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
Feedvalidator.com, and presumeably all feed readera, break because they apply the XSL stylesheet and then try to render/parse XHTML, which is not a valid feed format.
Does feedvalidator.com really belong to any of these possible <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/media.html">CSS @media types</a>?
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>all</dt>
        <dd>Used for all media type devices</dd>
    <dt>aural</dt>
        <dd>Used for speech and sound synthesizers</dd>
    <dt>braille</dt>
        <dd>Used for braille tactile feedback devices</dd>
    <dt>embossed</dt>
        <dd>Used for paged braille printers</dd>
    <dt>handheld</dt>
        <dd>Used for small or handheld devices</dd>
    <dt>print</dt>
        <dd>Used for printers</dd>
    <dt>projection</dt>
        <dd>Used for projected presentations, like slides</dd>
    <dt>screen</dt>
        <dd>Used for computer screens</dd>
    <dt>tty</dt>
        <dd>Used for media using a fixed-pitch character grid, like teletypes and terminals</dd>
    <dt>tv</dt>
        <dd>Used for television-type devices</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Not really. Or more importantly, we need a new type that is purposely geared for non-screen displaying, remote, automated parsers.
In addition to that, things like feedvalidator.com and and feed readers who simple load the XML doc and parse it (as apposed to displaying it as a whole document) should <strong>ignore</strong>
the media type of "screen".

So far though, RSS Reader is rock solid, and simple without all the extras to slow it down.

I definately like having an RSS reader inside of the browser instead of the other way around.

<p>
Yes, I haven't RTFM. Sue me. Now that I use the RSS Reader in Firebird, I've noticed at least three camps of feeds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Camp One</strong>: The Description node for each feed item is pure XHTML.  
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;description&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;
          This is a &lt;strong&gt;para&lt;/strong&gt;.
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/description&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Camp Two</strong>: The Description node for each feed item is XHTML in a CDATA node.
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;description&gt;
     &lt;![CDATA[
          &lt;p&gt;
               This is a &lt;strong&gt;para&lt;/strong&gt;.
          &lt;/p&gt;
     ]]&gt;
&lt;/description&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Camp Three</strong>: The Description node for each feed item is completely HTML encoded:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;description&gt;
     &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
          This is a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;para&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.
     &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/description&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
So, the question is thus: Which method is correct? Is the Description contents a payload to be delivered and not rendered as part of the feeds DOM, or simply part of the original XML feed document DOM?
</p>
<p>
The results across feed readers seems to be somewhat inconsistant. Some appear to play smart and sniff out the content. Some simply display the the HTML serialized into the DOM. Some display the HTML as is. What's the consensus?
</p>


<ins>
<p>
OK, so I'll do a little RTFMing.
</p>
<p>
According to the <a href="http://www.mnot.net/drafts/draft-nottingham-atom-format-02.html#rfc.section.3.1">Atom 0.3 Draft Spec</a>, the <samp>atom:content</samp> element has a <samp>mode</samp> attribute:
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
	<dt>"xml":</dt>
	<dd>A mode attribute with the value
	"xml" indicates that the element's content is inline
	xml (for example, namespace-qualified XHTML).
	</dd>
	<dt>"escaped":</dt>
	<dd>A mode attribute with the
	value "escaped" indicates that the element's content
	is an escaped string. Processors MUST unescape the
	element's content before considering it as content of
	the indicated media type.
	</dd>
	<dt>"base64":</dt>
	<dd>A mode attribute with the
	value "base64" indicates that the element's content is
	base64-encoded <a href="#RFC2045" title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies">[RFC2045]</a>. Processors
	MUST decode the element's content before considering
	it as content of the the indicated media type.
	</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, is data within a <code>&lt;![CDATA[ ]]&gt;</code> block considered "escaped"? I would think so, but hey. Who knows. Nice to see the Atom spec took this problem into account.
</p>
<p>
Now, what about RSS/RDF? If I have to pick a reason to like Atom feeds more, that little touch would probably be it.

I ran into this same issue.  In the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss" rel="nofollow">RSS 2.0 Specification</a>, it does not indicate one way or another.  I got around it by wrapping it in CDATA.  That's what seems to work in most clients.

I would assume a similar trick is necessary for the other versions of RSS.

<blockquote>
<p>
	From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this: 
	What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder 
	about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to 
	those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about 
	achieving 103%? What makes up 100% in life? 
</p>
<p>
	Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these 
	questions: 
</p>
<p>
	If:
</p>
<pre><samp>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26.</samp></pre>

<p>
	Then:
</p>
<pre><samp>H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%</samp></pre>

<p>
	And:
</p>
<pre><samp>K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%</samp></pre>

<p>
	But:
</p>
<pre><samp>A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%</samp></pre>

<p>
	And:
</p>
<pre><samp>B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T
2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%</samp></pre>

<p>
	And, look how far ass kissing will take you.:
</p>
<pre><samp>A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%</samp></pre>

<p>
	So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that While Hard 
	work and knowledge will get you close, and, Attitude will get you there, Bullshit 
	and Ass kissing will put you over the top.

My auto insurance is with State Farm, and they've never done me wrong. The womans auto insurance is with MetLife. We are NOT married, but living together. Whenever she calls them to change her address from the old house, they want a copy of my proof of insurance, and/or my SS#. 
</p>
<p>
My response to her (it's not her fault) is to tell them to take a hike. My insurance and my SS# for that matter, is none of their friggin business. They then tell her that without it, they'll put me on her insurance.  My response is, if that happens, to call them and demand they remove me. This kind of shit drives me crazy
</p>
<p>
When she lived at her old apartment, these bozos put her upstairs neighbors' 16 year old  on HER insurance policy without even asking just because they had the same address. Imagine the trouble that would cause if he had an accident?
</p>
<p>
A friend at work had problems with his insurance company because someone who live at his address before him had an accident? What the fuck is wrong with these people?  That said, the problem is this <acronym title="Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange">CLUE</acronym> bullshit.
</p>
<p>
Now I'm fine with insurance companies sharing accident history. But who is the fucking moron that decided that auto history should be <strong>BY ADDRESS</strong> and not by SS#, or drivers licence number? Retarded.

I think your common sense parser is set to strict and the rest of the world is parsing rather more liberally. Don't be so Safari baby, be more IE...

I'm thinking about upgrading Perl on the web server. It's currently the base FreeBSD install of 5.005_3 and I want to move to 5.6.1.  Part of me says if it ain't broke, don't fix it. However, two important modules [to me] now require Perl 5.6.0 or above: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Class::DBI&amp;mode=module">Class::DBI 0.95+</a> and  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=DBI&amp;mode=module">DBI 1.38+</a>.
</p>
<p>
I think the crappy part is going to be reinstalling all the Perl modules from ports  into the new Perl distrib. What fun.

OK, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Test::Pod&amp;mode=module">this Test module</a> is really really sick in a cool sort of way. For those who hate writing documentation even more than writing unit tests, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Test::Pod&amp;mode=module">Test::Pod</a> is for you. And for the really sick at heart, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Test::Pod::Coverage&amp;mode=module">Test::Pod::Coverage</a> can compare your Pod to your module and make sure you're documentating those new subs you've just added.

<p>
Anyone out there do any tinkering with Apache::Test? Here's my problem. Whenever I'm doing normal tests, the working directory is the project root. I can reference files in the test folder via <samp>t/somefile</samp>. The minute I load and use Apache::Test, it changes my working directory to <samp>t</samp>, thus breaking all references to <samp>t/somefile</samp>.
</p>
<p>
So my first question is whether this is a feature or a bug. Second, what's the best way to deal with this? I can either <samp>chdir</samp> up to the root if I'm inside of <samp>t/</samp> or change the test files to alter the file path based on the current working directory.
</p>
<p>
Of course, my other gripe is Apache::Test isn't quoting the <samp>httpd.conf</samp> paths sent to the Apache binary, so I'm forced to move my Apache install to <samp>C:\</samp>  when developing on Windows. Nice.

I've been trying to get it working over the last month. It's been quite the adventure! Once you figure it out, it's a very nice tool for testing web applications.

There was a recent discussion on the mailing list regarding working directories. I believe the outcome of the discussion was that cwd would no longer be performed. I also think this change is in CVS now. It sounded like it would take awhile to get the all of tests working with this modification.

My workaround is to check the working dir and append t/ if not already present. Fortunately, I have only 1 test which needs this hack.

As for the quoting issue, you ought to mention it on the mailing list or, better yet, provide a patch.

Yeah, I'm actually a lurker on the test-dev@ mailing list and noticed the CVS fix.

Now the real question is: will my hackaround still work after the fix makes it into a release?

Stan by Eminem meets Rob (CmdrTaco). Very funny. Very scary.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Slashdot's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all<br />
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all<br />
And even if I could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall<br />
It reminds me, that it's not so bad -- it's not so bad
</p>
<p>
Dear Rob, I wrote but you still ain't callin<br />
I left my email, my ICQ, and my yahoo chat at the bottom<br />
I sent two emails back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em<br />
There probably was a problem with your sendmail or somethin<br />
Sometimes I scribble email addees too sloppy when I jot 'em<br />
but anyways; fsck it, what's been up? Man how's your boxes?<br />
My boxes is linux too, I'm bout to be a compiler<br />
once I learn gcc,<br />
I'ma go on and compile for hours<br />
I read about your Palm Pilot too I'm sorry<br />
I had a friend lose his Palm over at the airport in Maradonna<br />
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan<br />
I even read all your bullshit Linux news and Microsoft's man<br />
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man<br />
I like the way you sold your ass out too, that shit was fat<br />
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,<br />
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan<br />
This is Stan
</p>
<p>
Dear Rob, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance<br />
I ain't mad - I just think it's FSCKED UP you don't answer fans<br />
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your Linux World<br />
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew<br />
That's my Senior sys admin he's only 26 years old<br />
We waited on a 9600 baud for you,<br />
four hours and you just said, "No."<br />
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fsckin idol<br />
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do<br />
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to<br />
Remember when we met in Boston - you said if I'd write you<br />
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way<br />
I never had a clue about shit either<br />
I gcc'd shit with my wife then beat her<br />
I can relate to what you're saying in your page<br />
so when I feel like rmusering I read Slashdot to begin the rage<br />
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed<br />
I even got a tattoo of slashdot across the chest<br />
Sometimes I even packet myself to see how much it floods<br />
It's like adrenaline, the DDoS is such a sudden rush of blood<br />
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it<br />
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7<br />
But she don't know you like I know you Rob, no one does<br />
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up<br />
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose<br />
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.<br />
We should be together too
</p>
<p>
Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Waste-A-Packet-On-My-Fans,<br />
this'll be the last packet I ever send your ass<br />
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?<br />
I know you got my last two emails<br />
I wrote the @ signs on 'em perfect<br />
So this is my payload I'm sending you, I hope you hear it<br />
I'm on my modem now, I'm doing 9600 baud so fear it<br />
Hey Rob, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to code?<br />
You know the song by Deep Purple or Slayer<br />
its irrelevant by playing on my linux player<br />
while I write some php scripts and play some Dragonslayer<br />
That's kinda how shit is, you coulda rescued me from drowning<br />
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downloads now, I'm drowsy<br />
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call<br />
I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall<br />
I love you Rob, we coulda been together, think about it<br />
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it<br />
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it<br />
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me<br />
See Rob {*screaming*} Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to code<br />
Hey Rob, that's my senior admin screamin from the comode<br />
but I didn't cut the power off, I just rebooted, see I ain't like you<br />
cause if rm -rf'd we'd suffer more, and then the boxes die too<br />
Well, gotta go, I'm almost BGP bridged now<br />
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this packet out?
</p>
<p>
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy<br />
You said your box is running now, how'd you like your gcc?<br />
Look, I'm really flattered you would install 7.0 Redhat<br />
and here's an autograph for your senior sys admin<br />
I wrote it on the Starter cap<br />
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you<br />
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you<br />
But what's this shit you said about you like to DDoS lamers too?<br />
I say that shit just clownin dog,<br />
c'mon - how fucked up is you?<br />
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling<br />
so heres some more Linux stories to keep your ass busy when you get down some<br />
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?<br />
I sold Slashdot for thousands so now I'm a single jetsetter<br />
I really think you and your boxes need each other<br />
or maybe you just need to treat them better<br />
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time<br />
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine<br />
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan why are you so mad?<br />
Try to understand, that Linux and MS is just grand<br />
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit<br />
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick<br />
Some dude was drunk and switched his router for a bridge<br />
and his packets were blackholed, and his DNS couldn't get digged<br />
and in the colo they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to<br />
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you<br />
Damn!

Hmmm... that's a tricky one.  "use" is done at compile time (and is the equivilent of a "require" and "import" done in sequence) while the other two (aforementioned "require" and "import") are done during run time.

I am assuming that has something to do with it, but you would need someone with a deeper understanding to explain further.

(I say that as I open up the perldoc pages to begin researching it myself...)

Well, it's bad enough I'm knee deep in Test::More and Apache::Test, but to have to understand what I'm doing on top of that? Oh the humanity.

Maybe I'll luck out, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159059018X/" rel="nofollow">Writing Perl Modules for CPAN</a> will touch on integrating both types of tests in the t/ directory.

I knew I was running low on karma points. Today we went to the carpet place at lunch to pick up some cheap carpet for a few spots in the old house before we put it up for sale. After work, we headed over to the old crib to yank up the old carpet and clean out a room so the installers could do their magic.
</p>
<p>
About ten minutes into this we hear a big pop-hissssssssssss. Our old water heater blew it's drain plug clean off; rusted out. So, 7 hours later and way to much $, the <strong>OLD HOUSE WE'RE SELLING</strong> has a new hot water tank. <strong>#$%^%$#</strong>!
</p>
<p>
On the bright side of this, it's another selling point. Not only that, but if it would've broke and we weren't there, it would've kept spewing out water. Bad. So at least it waited until we were there to go bezerk.

I'm in the middle of converting an old ASP site to Perl/ModPerl, Apache and MySQL.
Nothing to amazing there. But now that I'm writing a lot of tests for the modules, I have this overwhelming urge to try them on a different platform.
</p>
<p>
While I'd really like to do this testing on a new dual G5, I don't think the woman will go for it before she gets her new couch for the new house. :-) However, I do have this old beige "OldWorld" G3 sitting around that hasn't been fired up in at least a year. I know it will run <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/">NetBSD</a>. And I'm <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/darwin/6.0/install.ppc.txt">pretty sure</a> it would run <a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/">Darwin</a>.
</p>
<p>
So, the real question is, which one should I pick? Both are going to be quite similiar to what I'm used to [FreeBSD].

This feels like such a hack, but it works. I simply want to weed out constraint errors from other errors within Class::DBI.
</p>
<pre><code>try {
    $cart = $self-&gt;create($data);
} catch Error with {
    my $E = shift;
    if ($E-&gt;text =~ /^validate_column_values error:\s+(.*)?\s+Commerce/i) {

    } else {
        throw Commerce::Exception(%{$E});
    };
};</code></pre>
<p>
I'm sure there is some <code>$SIG{__DIE__}</code> or <code>Carp::croak</code> symbol table magic I could work. But that's assuming I know what the hell I'm doing in the first place.

<p>
Assuming I can get to it at the right time, there is the <samp>HandleError</samp> attribute of DBI clases. That might do it.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. Nick has a great talent for making  software visually appealing, flexible with many options, and functional; all in the same program. That's quite a talent in a pool of over complicated, ugly, unusable pieces of software.</p>
<p>
I do find the software activation annoying at best, but I don't mind. Why? 
Because the software has a practical license: I  can use if on ANY machine I own. Now, if Microsoft would just learn that lesson, I'd hate them, and $500 Office a little less.

Oh yeah, this was the first time I've flown commercial. It wasn't so bad. Not bad at all actually considering I won't go near roller coasters. :-)

Now that I've wiped my laptop, and forcing my self to use RunAs a little more religously, I've decided to install Perl 5.8.3 this time around.

Much to my surprise, the ppm in 5.8.3 works much better than in 5.6.1 and I was able to install Class::DBI in a snap. Under 5.6.1, Class::Iterators and Accessor / IMDB junk threw up fits everywhere requireing manual installs via CPAN with loads of tinkering.

<p>
Today has been a hard day. I'm definately coming to a crossroads here. Do I accept the status quo and let things continue as is at work, or do I fight the machine and make things happen? That's a tough decision.
</p>
<p>
I understand the realities or business, money, priorities and practicalities. I'm ok with those things in general. But it's getting harder and harder to go along with sacrificing quality for priority and quantity.
</p>
<p>
Is it wrong for me to want to do the right thing; to want to do technical documentation; to do unit testing; to do page validation? I don't think it is. But when you're faced with getting things done quickly, try explaining your programming integrity to your boss' boss. I know he understands. But the business never understands that these things help in the long run, even if the can't be quantified and given time in the interim.
</p>
<p>
When it's all said and done, it still comes down to one reality; one choice: be a cog in the machine, or brave the harsh currents to make change happen without more support? 
</p>
<p>
Sigh.

I think the time has come to sell <a href="/blog/images/offtopic/truck.png">the big red fun toy</a>. I'll be sad to see her go, but I believe now is the proper time to set her free.
</p>
<p>
She has really low mileage (&lt;30,000) and the body is is almost great shape.
The problem is, the paint needs to be reworked on both doors. There's a tad of surface rust and a few bubbles, but nothing structural that will require a good bare metal prep and paint job. I have no urge to fund that process again. 
</p>
<p>
On top of that, she's completely paid for. I could buy a new vehicle with the proceeds and still be loan free. That doesn't suck at all.

However, we still want to be able to haul things when necessary, so a minivan is a must. We drove a 2004 Ford Freestar to St. Louis and it was nice. The bummer is that those only have a 3 year warranty?!@# What the hell is that about. At least the Kias have a 10/100,000 warranty in place.

<p>
<strong>@#$%$#@</strong> So, Scoble has has asked before what they can do to get people to use .NET. First and foremost,  get VS.NET to leave my gosh darned source code formatting alone. I really want to convert. But the fact that no matter how hard I try I still can't get VS.NET and Web Matrix to leave my source code alone still infuriates me within the first 5 minutes of ".netting'".
</p>
<p>
Case in point. This went into a new file.
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;Redesign Layout Maneuvers&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;

	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
And a code view, html view, design view and a save later, this is what I have left:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;
&lt;HTML lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;HEAD&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;Redesign Layout Maneuvers&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;
		&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;
	&lt;/HEAD&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;

	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Take note of what happened to my XML declaration. Nice. Are there hidden options somewhere to curb this behaviour? Probably. But I shouldn't have to find them. Could I just not ever touch Design view? That's not practical with code gen for objects, and other developers who know less and can't just write the code.
</p>
<p>
Don't even get me started on the non-compliant, or even not-even-remotely-close compliancy of the HTML this stuff pukes out.
</p>
<p>
No thank you. I'll go back to mod_perl and a text editor (Textpad). Maybe when Longhorn and 2.0 .NET hits I'll try again. :-/

Greate. So I can hold off all ASP.NET development until what, 2007?

Thank the lord for text editors. In the long run I'm sure [as usual] doing things by hand will lead to more efficient code instead of dragging along all the cruft that I'd get by the IDE playing smart for me.

If you want to use textpad, you better use
Visual Studio and don't touch the design view - everything would be perfect.

Re: Anatoly

ANd therein lies the problem. If I'm working with 2-5 other developers, I can't possibly expect the Design View tab to never get clicked. Accidents happen. I click renders the source useless.  That's not acceptable.

The fundamentals of VS seem to support xhtml, but layers of stuff over the basics are ill behaved.  Some ways to get what you want:
1)  Start in source mode.  If you can, never touch that horrible design mode.
2)  If you use design mode (like placing controls) do it at the start of building an aspx.  After using it fix the information that has been messed up.  Then never go in again.
3)  If you touch an aspx with design mode put the header into the clipboard first!
4)  After the development is done load it into a staging web server.  Go in there with some decent tools (Homesite still has a place...) and fix the formatting.  Publish to live site from there.

If you're using the xhtml (produced by your ASPX) from code this is NOT optional.

I'd love to see an alternative to the "design surface".  The UI in Homesite based on WYSIWYN (What you see is what you need) is so superior it takes you breath away.

Now, if you're running XP as a user without administrator (and probably power user) privs, <strong>make sure you format the removable stick/usb drive using NTFS</strong>. I failed to do so the first time, and firefox complained about the drive being read only, even thought it wasn't. Rumor this is an XP/FAT32 issue.

Call me a sick little monkey, but I enjoy doing C# via text editor and command line compiling way more than fighthing an IDE. Even without Intellisense help, I find myself happy that I'm actually learning to code C# rather than haviing an IDE to do it for me.
</p>
<p>
As for the project itself. A long time ago I packet sniffed a windows only client for the Minisoft Middleman client/server software for HP MPE and wrote a set of perl modules to do the client portion on Unix. Now that I'm looking into ASP.NET and possibly moving away from Minisoft towards just pure sockets, I'm gonna try writing a .NET library with interfaces so I can switch to a new protocl/sockets only client later without changing the consuming ASP.NET code.

Every now and then, I'll remember parts of dreams I'm pretty sure I have over and over again.\
</p>
<p>
In the most vivd one I can remember, I'm in college, but the building is my high school, and I suddenly remember that I have a class that I need to pass that I've never been two for the first half of the semester. Then I scramble  to find the right classroom.
</p>
<p>
Damn strange huh? Near as I can figure, it some hidden stress related thing. I took ~23 credit hours for 5 and a half years in college. Maybe it's some anxiety realted issue.
</p>
<p>
The other, or maybe even the part of the same dream is in the same high school. I forget the combination to my locker and I panic.
</p>
<p>
Go figure. I've always been good at memorizing numbers, phone number I use only once, combos, etc. Had a real gift for memorizing music clickly, especially things with patterns. Apparently, my brain is afraid of forgetting things.

It allows you to switch between multiple sets of proxy settings which is awesome since I use a proxy at home, and a proxy at work with different sets of exceptions and ports.

Grrrr. Why in the hell doesn't System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient (or the pure System.Net.Socket interface) have a ConnectTimeout option? I know. There is a SendTimeout and a ReceiveTimeout, even and the socket options level. Why is there no connection timeout? IF the remote server is offline, the connect takes forever to timeout.
</p>
<p>
Sure, I can jump through god knows how many hoops and dump the Connect into another timed thread, but  k'mon. That's silly.  Apparently the perl IO::Socket couterpart spoiled me into thinking it was something people actually wanted to change rather tha have everything grind to a halt waiting on a dead remote host. :-/

Here here!

I totally agree more. I've just spent an hour wasting my time trying to figure out why ReceiveTimeout didn't affect the timeout for connecting. 

Do you know if there are there any plans in the pipeline to implement a ConnectTimeout or equivalent?

I don't see any way in the documentation to do this with a TcpClient, but if you had a System.Net.Sockets.Socket instead, you could use BeginConnect/EndConnect to do a connection timeout.

I had to do something similar a while back.  I ended up creating a private wrapper class holding a reference to the Socket, plus a reference to a ManualResetEvent.  When I need to do the connect, I set up a new wrapper, then called the Socket's BeginConnect method (the state object is the wrapper class).  In the AsyncCallback delegate's target method, I Set() the event, then call EndConnect() on the socket.

Back in the main function, I do a WaitOne on the ManualResetEvent (the overload that has a timeout).  If the timeout elapses, then I close the socket (which invokes the AsyncCallback, which when I call EndConnect(), throws either a SocketException with ErrorCode 10061, or an ObjectDisposedException, which I ignore).  Otherwise, I continue, and close the socket later.

It's only about 15-25 lines of code in all.  Of course, that's still a heck of a lot more than a Connect overload that takes a timeout, but it is at least possible.

If you could get at the Socket reference of the TcpClient, you could do something similar.  But I don't think you can (I don't believe the Socket is even created until you try to connect the TcpClient, though I could be wrong on that).

The killing of people can never be justified.

All I'm saying is that his methods of rule may have been born more out of necessity that out of personality.

I need help. I know the answer is simple, but I don't see it. I can't figure out why some people RSS/Atom feeds that include XSL stylesheets validate and some peoples don't validate (mine). FeedValidator barfs trying to validate my XSLT's XHTML output instead of just the raw feed XML. For people whos feed validates, it ignores the xml-stylesheet processing instruction and just validats the RSS. My brain hurts.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/rss.jsp">One that validates</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/blog/atom.xml">...and mine that doesn't</a>
</p>
<p><strong>It's official. I'm a retard.</strong> You think that I would remember that all XML files pass through AxKit since the site is built on it. So of course, the XSLT was happening on the server. Now all is happy. Time to tweak the stylesheets and add some CSS. Now the only retarded thing is Mozilla's lack of output-escaping in XSLT.</p>

I have an opinion question for anyone who actually reads this blog.
I need to take an incoming data stream and turn it into a set of objects. At the basic level, this is just a form of serialization. 
</p>
<p>
The incoming text is currently just ASCII over the network and I was entertaining the through of using a StreamReader/StreamWriter to abstract that point. Once I get the text, I currently just parse it and load those properties into a newly created object. This seems like a hack at the conceptual level.
</p>
<p>
Is there a more appropriate way to do this, like create a custom serializer to transform the text into objects, or am I just spinning my wheels?

After constantly digging around for API Assembly documentation on MSDN, I decided MS needs something better.
</p>
<p>
Let's assume I don't have 2GB of VS.NET installed, or maybe I'm not even on a Windows machine [Mono]. I want to read the API docs for System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient. Currently, I can go to Google and find it. Sometimes I can even do and MSDN search and find it. But the MSDN library navigation blows in non IE browsers. Reloading whole frames sets when I just wans to select another node, etc.
</p>
<p>
So, here's my wish: Dear MSDN website crew, please create a jump point on the msdn.microsoft.com website that will toss people right where they need to go.
</p>
<p>
For example, http://msdn.microsoft.com/netapi/System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient forwards me to http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemNetSocketsTcpClientClassTopic.asp.
</p>
<p>
For that matter, have someone make an IE toolbar addin to do it and also make a Mozilla/Firefox search plugin for it. That would make my day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update: </strong> It looks like there is already a Mozilla/Firefox plugin. Bravo. That 1/3 of the way there.

Thanks to Dad's help [again], we now have a new rear steel entry door into the garage and two new storm doors on the back of the house. Since the previous owner never put storm doors on or painted the rear door frames, the garage entry door was pretty much rotted at the bottom of the frame.
</p>
<p>
To make matters more fun, they poured the concrete garage floor AFTER they put in the door. Half of the space under the door threshold was empty space and they didn't waste any effort in insulating under or around the door.
</p>
<p>
After we installed the new door, we used that expanding foam insulation around and under the door. I swear it's warmer in that garage already. Should be interesting to see if it makes a difference next winter, especially if I get a new garage door seal on as well.

I feel like and absentte landlord for this site right now. Work is burning me out with multiple "high priority" overdue projects at once, and things have been busy around here.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/blog/archives/entries/000467/">The truck</a> is is sold and the proceeds have paid off all the appliances for this house and my credit card, which is now closed. More on that later. 
</p>
<p>
Now it looks as if the old house may be close to selling as well, which means I can pay off my 2 month old car loan. That puts us down to a single mortgage and car loan which means we can finally get "settled" again.
</p>
<p>
Now back to the credit card. It was a CapitalOne card with a semi-crappy rate. Every damn month or so, those idiots would send me "Now, new low rates if you sign up now" snail mail spam, which was stupid considering I was <em>already</em> their customer. Everytime I would call to see if they would lower the rate, and they refused. Now, when I called to payoff the card and cancel my account, they wanted to know why. So I told them about the monthly offers and the refusals to lower my rate.
</p>
<p>
Of course, now that I'm closing my account they want to lower my rate. I told them to get bent. They had their chance. That was fun. :-)

It's always the stupid little things. I needed to finish an upgrade to Bind9 that I started a long time ago. I had stopped at the point that I needed to add an additional IP to the Slave DNS server so I could get "internal" and "external" views' zone files.

named_program="/home/bind9/usr/named"

I bought a new push mower yesterday. 
We've got 1 acre, but we only mow about 2/3 of it. The front yard is easy, but the back yard is wet, sloped and the grass is mega thick and high (since it's been to wet to mow yet). I have a 5 year old 4HP push mower that could do the job, but it's going to struggle with it and I don't really want to spend $2000+ for a good riding lawn mower just yet.
</p>
<p>
We were at Sam's Club and she was getting a new cell phone. Right behind us was an MTD Pro Self-Propelled 21" 6.5HP Swivel Wheel push mower  for $377. Interesting price I thought.
</p>
<p>
Later that day, we stopped at Sears and Lowes. Lowes sells the Cub Cadet (the one in the picture) version that is <strong>exactly</strong> the same; literally. Same features, made by the same company, sold under different name with a different paint job (MTD Pro is red) for $478.
</p>
<p class="image">
<a href="/blog/images/hardware/mower.jpg"><img src="/blog/images/hardware/mower_small.jpg" alt="MTD Pro SR621" /></a>
</p>
<p>
So, back to Sam's Club we we for the same mower $100 cheaper. Good deal I think.

Glad to know I'm not the only guy with a wet backyard in need of mowing... it's horrible.

How do you like the MTD PRO.  Does it handle rounded grass areas better than a standard mower?  I heard with the solid 6 speed drive (chain) it is difficult to back up.  Comments Please as I am about to order from SamsClub but would like some user experience feedback first.

I like it just fine. It was hard to get used to the first day, but
after that it's fine.
If you're going to mow at an angle, like next to the road/ditch,
you'll befinately want to lock the front wheels.

It's not hard to pull in reverse at all.

Also, it would be eaiser toreply if you're email wasn't undeliverable. :-)

Hey, I am going to have a lawn to mow for the 1st time and I am shopping for a mower .. lawn is around 1/4 acre or more..I was looking at this mower at Sam's also and saw it in store for around 299 now. I was trying to figure out if it was better to go with this than a Craftsman Mower in same price range? any suggesitons? Also is this a self propelled or push mower and would you recommend it for a beginner? Thanks!

IMHO, if we want to save face with the world about these abuse photos, we need to let these abusers be tried for war crimes under the Geneva Convention by a country not involved in the war. Nothing less will do. Anything less is a joke related to 'fair' justice.
</p>
<p>
On that note, while I don't condone the abuse, I understand it. Some of these soldiers are "National Guard". They aren't suppoed to be overseas in a war. Period. They're supposed to be here to protect us in the time of need. Probably not trained for an overseas war. They're already stressing. So I can see how these things happen.

Ya know the older I get, the more silly things really really <strong>really</strong> bug me, especially things around the house.
</p>
<h3>Water</h3>
<p>
When you buy a 6 year old house that has the appropriate pipe, gravel, drains, and sump pump, you expect a dry basement. Apparently not. I've got a little water coming in right where the floor and wall me directly under where the sewer pipe leaves the house. Now the front porch slab was never sealed between it and the house. That's problem one. The gutter in the front appears to be draining poorly even though it has grating over top to prevent leavage; probably cause #2. How frustrating.
</p>
<p>
At least in the old house, when I had the basement waterproffed, it sure was dry.
</p>
<h3>Ants</h3>
<p>
When you buy a house and the pest inspection agency supposedly sprays for ants, you expect to see no ants. Apparently not. I ran into about 10 or so black ants upstairs and now about a dozen or so small clear/red ants in the kitchen.  After the rains, they been crawling up the basement block on the outside despite the supposed spraying and also some more granual treament. Time to try spray again.
</p>
<h3>More Water</h3>
<p>
The wind and rain have been so bad lately that the window in the basement leaked between the two sliding panes. There was water all over the inside sills and glass. Now the one without a screen on the bottom half outside leaked. The one with the screan didn't. Now here's the retarded part: I have a screen for the second window, but it doesn't remotely fit. How in the hell did they install two windows and have one of the screens be completely the wrong size? It doesn't even come close to the size of any other window in the house. WTF?

Bugger! Seems to me, that's why the people sold that house. Unfortunately it's been you, buying it. What was the reason again for leaving the old house? Anyway, I am sure you will take this challenge successfully, too.
Good luck,

Maybe, but it's a six year old house. The lady who we bought it from didn't even live there for that last two years. She got married and moved to Maine. It's not like it's a 50k house, it's a big phat colonial.

Oh well. Find me a house without any problems and I have some swampland in Florida to sell you. :-)

I'm a big Lewis Black fan. On of his rants goes roughly like this: "I knew if was the end of days when I walked out of a Starbucks, looked across the street, and saw another Starbucks!".

We went and saw Shrek 2 last night and I kid you not. In one part of the movie, a giant gingerbread guy tears the large Starbuck-like cup off of the Starbuck-like building and all of the people in side scream and run out and across the street into another Starbucks-like store. Too funny.
</p>
<p>
The Far Far Away town was funny like that, they had popular-like store logos and titles like "The Olf Naverly". All in all, it was a damn funny movie.

Then again, I should still be working on that other site conversion that has yet to happen. Go figure.

Changes are afoot at ICF. MovableType 3.0 is installed. I'm also ditching AxKit for my blog and sticking with just plain olde XHTML.

I think I stop posting as often because is was just to damn complicated when something needed fixed.

I'm also changing the individual entry archive file names, so I'll have to do some mod_rewrite magic later one. All the old stuff should still be running available at this point. There's that "S" word again. :-)

Man there is no feeling like writing a $20,000 check and paying off your two month old car loan on a 2003 vehicle.

Lord knows what terrorist flags I've set off in the last two months by depositing $10,000+ in cash after selling the truck [<em>Yes, I did have to fill out special forms</em>] and now depositing $18,000 after selling the old house and quickly sending it out again to pay off the car.

I used to spit out individual entry archives into files named after each entries id.
</p>
<p>
For example, entry 300 was located at <samp>/blog/archives/entries/0003000/</samp>. I've since moved to using the entry title as the file name, so I have to figure out how to redirect the old links to the new locations. The easiest way to do this seems to be a quick and dirty <samp>mod_rewrite</samp> and a CGI script.
</p>
<p>
Here's the RedirectMatch directive:
</p>

<pre><code>
RewriteEngine   on
RewriteRule     ^/blog/archives/entries/([0-9]{1,6})(/|\.xsp)$  /cgi-bin/mt-byid.cgi?entry_id=$1 [R=301,L]
</code></pre>

<p>
And here's the CGI itself:
</p>

<pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wT
use strict;

my($MT_DIR);
BEGIN {
    if ($0 =~ m!(.*[/\\])!) {
        $MT_DIR = $1;
    } else {

    };
    unshift @INC, $MT_DIR . 'lib';
    unshift @INC, $MT_DIR . 'extlib';
    push @INC, $MT_DIR . 'plugins';
};

eval {

        my $permalink;
        my $query = CGI->new;

        if ($entry_id !~ /^\d{1,6}$/) {
                $entry_id = 0;
        };

        my $mt = MT-&gt;new;
        my $entry = MT::Entry-&gt;load({id =&gt; $entry_id});

Next, please explain to my simple self, how do you manage php in xhtml 1.1 being served application/xhtml+xml ?

Or can it only be managed by the using php to send the headers ?

Dear Software Vendors,

Please, for the love of all that is holy, get a friggin clue and make sure your software runs for users that don't have Administrator privileges!

Here's two software companies on my shit list for this inability.

First, Macromedia HomeSite 5.5 completely bombs when run as a normal user. Even after installing the program when logged in as an Administrator interactively (not using <kbd>runas</kbd>). No, I won't be trying your product anytime soon.

Offender number two is Jasc's Paintshop Pro 8. While it installs fine, it refuses to run as a normal user requesting that it be run with an account that has Administrator privileges. While the message mentions this is a restriction for the Trial version, I'd never buy the full version just to find out that it doesn't work there either.

Now I understand why people run their crap as accounts in the Administrators group on Windows. Because most Windows application developers are lazy, incompetent, or both.

I think the only thing I trust less than most car salesmen are furniture salesmen.

We're in the market for new furniture in the livingroom. The cats have schredded the lazyboy double recliner. Nothing shocking for cats with claws, and so far, it's the only thing they have clawed.

We're looking for something that's mostly wood with the exception of the cushions. It's easier to have cushions reclothed than have an antire couch redone.

<img src="/blog/images/offtopic/mission.jpg" alt="Mission Style Couch" />

We found a great custom made Amish mission style sectional at one of the local furniture stores, but man it was horribly expensive. It was about $2800 for each piece (3 seat) of the sectional. Ouchie! Now greanted it was solid as a rock, and made of Hickory, but the last thing I want is another large debt just for furniture.

On a whim, I stopped buy another local shop: Amish Valley Oak Furniture. Great place. I love AMish made furniture. It's 100% solid wood. Stuff that lasts a lifetime. They had some mission style couches and chairs in ctalogs, but nothing in the store (although they had lots of furniture there). Their prices were lower; affordable even. :-)

They Margeaux found <a href="http://www.amish-oak.com/">Amish Oak</a> online. Their prices complete kick the ass of the local place, and they even have the very same <a href="http://www.amish-oak.com/web_store/web_store.cgi?category=Living_Room&amp;style=missionn17">mission style couch</a> we want. Even better is the fact that they have a showroom and it's only about 60 miles or so away. Road Trip!!!!!

Now the fun part starts tomorrow night: confronting the local shop on why their prices are so high for the same thing. :-)

There is also a mission style Morris Chair.  It's a manaul recliner of sorts. There are pegs in the back that you raise or lower to alter the recline of the back of the chair. Of course there's a matching Ottoman as well.

The more I try other "editors", the more I appreciated <a href="http://www.textpad.com/">Textpad</a>. I was always in love with the fact that I could pick my line endings and encodings and it would Do The Right Thing. Even better, I loved that I could save Unicode/UTF-16/UTF-8 files and choose whether or not to write the <acronym title="Byte Order Marker">BOM</acronym>. Writing the BOM usually plays hell with things like ASP/.NET, so any program that <em>always</em> writes the BOM causes problems.

Yet another case in point. I tried a full copy of HomeSite 5.5 at work today. "Great!" I thought. It has PC/Mac/Unix line ending support and I could choose UTF-8 as my file encoding.

Sure enough, it <em>always</em> writes the BOM without any option to turn it off. At least Macromedia <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/homesite/ts/documents/unicode_issues.htm">is aware</a> of the issue. Back to Textpad I go.

And yes, I know about UltraEdit and Notepad2. I never liked UltraEdit because the interface was too busy and strayed from the standard windows toolbar icons. As for Notepad2, time to try it again.

BODY:
Anyone who knows me for more than two minutes knows that the tactics, technology and laws the MPAA/RIAA try shoving down our throats really piss me off. So do those bullshit CD copy protection schemes. All this shit for the "war on piracy" really means I can't make a backup of my $50 game in case the CD get's scratched, or rip my favorite CD and put it on an MP3 player.

The innocents rights get fucked by a greedy outdated industry trying to stop "piracy" while the true pirates, the ones that make 500,000 copies at a time and <em>sell them</em>, go untouched by these technology locks and barriers.

So it's no surprise that I find <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=519&amp;e=17&amp;u=/ap/police_shooting_piracy">this news story</a> quite symbolic of the problem these two groups are causing.

<blockquote>

NEW YORK - The entertainment industry tagged along when police raided a self-storage warehouse in Manhattan last year.

Private investigators hired by movie and recording industry groups had helped link a space in the warehouse to an alleged criminal operation pirating DVDs and compact discs. They were there when the officers moved in.

The teamwork might have gone unnoticed, if not for the raid's deadly outcome.

Undercover Officer Bryan Conroy was charged last week with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Ousmane Zongo, an unarmed African immigrant working inside the warehouse who was not involved in the alleged pirating scheme.

</blockquote>

Shoot first and ask questions later. It only would've been more accurate if that had used a shotgun. IF you listen to music, you're guilty.

There's a n <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/XML/BuildingXML/XMLinNETFramework/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnxmlnet/html/trblshtxsd.asp">new article</a> on MSDN about troubleshooting common XMLSerializer problems.

There's one thing with the StreamWriter/XMLSerializer/XMLTextWriter that really aggrivates me. I've torn my hair out the first time trying to figure out the problem only to be mystified at why the problem even exists.

At one point, every XML saved in UTF-8 unicode had three extra bytes (0xEFBBBF) at the beginning before <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"&gt;</code> started. This freaked ASP out, as well as certain versions of the Expat parser and many editors.

Once I remembered that it was the BOM (Byte Order Marker), I set about to find out how to turn it off. At first glance, there is no property anywhere to simply turn it off.

During the creation, you can pass in an encoding. There are two <em>extremely similiar</em> options that yield two completely different results.

The first is <code>System.Text.Encoding.UTF8</code>. With this option, the BOM is always written. There is no obvious way to turn it off.

<pre><code>wr = New XmlTextWriter("file.xml", New System.Text.Encoding.UTF8)</code></pre>

The second option is <code>System.Text.UTF8Encoding</code> which doesn't write the BOM.

<pre><code>wr = New XmlTextWriter("file.xml", New System.Text.UTF8Encoding())</code></pre>

Christ, those are really different aren't they. :-/
THat namespace/class nameing could have been just a little better.

So we picked up a copy of Quicken 2004 for the woman, and I snagged a copy as well since it was nearing a reasonable price (~$25). I tried pupdating the software from release version 1 to release verion 5. Every attempt at updating yielded the terribly helpful "Path engines failed bla bla bla".

After trying unsuccessfully many times to update Quick either online, or manually using the update files, I figured out the problem: spaces in paths and long file names! WTF?

This is from the <samp>update.log</samp>:

<pre><code>Extracting Quicken Dir update data to: C:\PROGRA~1\Quicken 2004\inet\common\patch\H130103R.RTP
Calling RTPatchApply: -i -not -sub "C:\WINDOWS" C:\PROGRA~1\Quicken 2004\inet\common\patch\H130103R.RTP</code></pre>

There's the culprit. The dipshit update doesn't quote the path to the RTP file. Not only that, but shouldn't it also be in a ~ short file name style?

Of course, this is only a problem if you install quicken into a directory other than "/Quicken". Good thing changing the install directory isn't an option during the install. :-/ Idiots.

On that note, I've re-enabled comments for regular old non-TypeKey users. I'm sure this means I'll have to spend time every other day deleting 100+ unapproved spam robot comments. How fun.

Apparently the Gecko rendering endinge isn't to happy with the <code>white-space</code> CSS rules applied to <code>textarea</code> elements. It's pretty much ignored if you specify <code>rows</code> or <code>cols</code>, or specify any CSS <code>width</code>. The text absolutely won't honor the preformatted text and wraps wherever it wants.

Of course, there's one way to make it work: use the <code>wrap="off"</code> attribute. Of course this doesn't validate in XHTML 1.0/1.1 Strict. I'll live with that guilt for now. :-)

Hey great, I now have a Gmail account. Now what? Just when Google announced it's Gmail 1GB feature, Yahoo paid customers (of which I am via SBC DSL) got an upgrade to 2GB.

I don't used that account either. Ever. Not once. Maybe I'll get some Gmail invites to spread around.

That is the only conclusion I can make after witnessing first hand the type of "new math" they use.

I went to get my medications refilled and that's when the fun started. For one of the pills, I could pay ~$8.00 for a 30 day supply through insurance, or <strong>I</strong> could pay ~$12.00 dollars for a <strong>90 day supply</strong> of the same thing without going through insurance. What the fuck is that?

No wonder insurance rates are skyrocketing and benifit quality and coverage is heading in a downward spiral.

Here's another example. Someone goes in for an MRI. The hospital bills ~$8000 for the procedure. The insurance company says, "oh no, we know it costs xxx" and pays ~$1500. The hospital knows full well it has to bill ~$8000 so it will get the amount to cover the cost. The price you or I would pay <em>without</em> insurance? Yep. <strong>~$8000</strong>.

Nice.

We went and saw Spiderman 2 this evening. I thought it was pretty darn good. I think it was better than the first one, but that was pretty good too.

Out of all the "marvel movies", these is certainly a lot better than the others (Punisher, DareDevil, Hulk).

This is about my only realy gripe with Firefox. I always wish I could change the size and/or position of the toolbar search box.

My laptop runs at 1600x1200, and my desktops run at 1280x1024. With those kinds of sizes, the search box is always waaaaaay over on the right when I need it. That's a pain in the ass in a reading left-to-right environment.

<ins><em>Yes, I just realized I can customize a toolbar and drag the search box to the left. That's on half of the problem solved.</em></ins>

I also wish I could click-drag the left side of the searchbox and make it larger. As a programmer, I'm usuall searching for much longer strings, especially when I'm searching MSDN for .NET namespaces.

I'm sure there is some XUL/CSS magic I could conjure up. I just shouldn't even have to.

<ins><em>Two for two. Apparently I'm <a href="http://www.digitalmediaminute.com/article/672">not the only one</a> who hates the size. Thanks for the CSS example.</em></ins>

I like Star Wars games, but only the First Person Shooter kind.I hear Galaxies is addictive as hell, but I'm not really interested in trying it.

I likes Enter The Matrix too, and I here there's a Matrix MMORPG in thre works. I like the idead, but I think it would need to be too complex to be worth it compared to the movie.

Now what I would really like to see is a Stargate SG-1 based MMORPG with the stargates, DODs, known and unknow enemies; the works. I think it would be just the right level of Sci-Fi vs. reality.

But hey, that's just me.

I saw a great movie today on the Independent Film Channel called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120731/">The Legend of 1900</a>. It's about a boy born on a ship  and left there to grow up. He becomes a piano virtuoso. He becomes so used to a life of limits that he can not bring himself to leave the ship and venture out into a limitless world; even when the ship is decommissioned.

I'll never eat at <a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/">The Cheesecake Factory</a> again as long as I live.

The most friendly sane experience of the evening was with the valet parking. The staff was mostly rude and slow. But the worst thing of all was their seating policy.

If you had 6 people in your party, but when they called your name only 5 people were present, you were not seated and your name wat put back at the bottom of the list. While I can almost understand the technical reasons for this, I believe in the end it serves no good reason other than to completely piss off your customers.

Don't get me started on how damn long it actually took to get a friggin salad.

No offense to the California readers, but this is Ohio, not a posh Hollywood/Beverly Hills restaurante. If I'm going to pay that kind of money, the service needs to be a whole lot better.

I'll stick to Applebee's thank you very much.

While this is still unconfirmed by results, I believe I learned a valuable lesson today about Google indexing, pagerank and doctypes.

After some hefty development last week, a group of pages went out with the doctype on the <em>second</em> line of the file, leaving the first line blank.

These new pages failed to be indexed by Google with any sense of earnest, and the ones that were indexed appeared low in the results compared to the previous set of pages [with different names]. However, new pages here on this site get indexed pretty quickly and searching for their entry titles yield high results.

After digging around on Google, I found a few obscure references from others with the same rare problem. Time will tell, but I have a hunch that things will miraculously work themselves out.

Todd Parish, a former reservist who completed his duty a year ago, is probably going to <a href="http://www.wral.com/news/3503822/detail.html">sue the Army</a> for being called to duty and will not go.

I completely agree with this guy. Both parties fulfilled their obligations. He is done and doesn't have to go back in my opinion. I would do exactly the same thing if I were in his shoes.

Now don't get me wrong. If this was a situation where a person on active duty fulfilled his duty and could end their service [but the government won't let people do that right now], I don't think they should be allowed to leave. I don't think they should even try to leave.

This case however is something entirely different. Of course, I don't believe in the draft either; at least not for something like IRAQ.

As a former reservist, I can sympathize with Mr. Parish - up to a point.  I can't speak as to the particulars of his enlistment contract.  However, in my experience, I was informed and aware of, up front, that after my 8 years of reserve duty were completed, that I would be then transferred to the IRR (Individual Ready Reserve), from which, in time of national need, I could be reactivated, until age 51.  The language in the enlistment contracts that I've seen from the different brances of service is very consistent about this.  I will be following Mr. Parish's case with interest.

I have to agree on that point. If he was informed verbally or contractually that he would be put in IRR and it's obligations, then I think he's just plain stuck.

Now, on that note, I think the manditory placement of people into the IRR is slightly questionable.

I agree with you on mandatory placement in the IRR, but my (former) father-in-law, who was an officer in the Army Signal Corps put it this way:   'After you sign on the dotted line, you're theirs.  Especially if your rate/MOS is considered critical.'  He finished his active duty with NASA doing satellite communications networks, then retired a few years ago, still consulting for NASA and the odd government agency.

Any one out there know how to change the default CSS style used fordisplaying XML documents?

Currently, when I load an XML file in Firefox, it uses the "Basuc Theme". I personally like the "Monospace" theme better and I'm tired of switching to it every time I load an XML file.

I'm sure the userContent.css file in my profile directly has something to do with it. If I just wanted to override all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags on the web, it would be easy. However, I have no clue on how to target all XML content using that mechanism.

Anyone?

Update-ola! I've figure this out somewhat.

Open up <kbd>Mozilla Firefox\chrome\comm.jar</kbd> in WinZip or some such program and edit the <samp>XMLPrettyPrint.css</samp> file until your hearts content.

I simply added the monospace CSS from <samp>XMLMonoPrint.css</samp> file in the same location.

For giggles, I also tried changing the following in <samp>XMLPrettyPrint.xsl</samp> from:

<pre>&lt;link href="chrome://communicator/content/xml/XMLPrettyPrint.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/&gt;
&lt;link title="Monospace" href="chrome://communicator/content/xml/XMLMonoPrint.css" type="text/css" rel="alternate stylesheet"/&gt;</pre>

to something like

<pre>&lt;link href="chrome://communicator/content/xml/XMLMonoPrint.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/&gt;
&lt;link title="Stock Style" href="chrome://communicator/content/xml/XMLPrettyPrint.css" type="text/css" rel="alternate stylesheet"/&gt;</pre>

It didn't quite work right. While it did change the font to monospace, the colors were no longer there. I'm sure it's just an import/namespace order issue I missed.

Happy hacking.

I forgot to mention it before, and I was gone all day yesterday with Margeaux and my parents. I'm 31. [And there was much rejoicing....yeeeaaahhh].

We picked my parents up for breakfast in the morning, then we drove out to Amish country and hit some antique malls in the area. We didn't pick up a lot of stuff. Just some Siamese cat salt/pepper shakers, some other Siamese figurines. We also snagged this really tall hand driven water pump for the front yard.

I'd post a pick of it but I don't have a digital camera. Well, we had one, but it's life was ended prematurely on the concrete garage floor. Maybe I should go fix that this evening. Any recommendations?  I want good picture quality, but I don't need to many bells and whistles.

Anyone out there have any experience with <kbd>regasm</kbd> and creating COM Callable Wrappers for .NET assemblies?

I've successfully created a CCW for a .NET assembly I've been working on, but I'm having some issues with what it decides to expose to COM and what it wants to name those methods.

The first problem, and I think this is a big problem, is that it appears to work it's way up from the bottom when it comes to inheritance. One would think it would make more sense to start at the top with the most public view of an assembly and work your way back down to the base class.

This is an especially tough thing to deal with when you are inheriting another class you aren't in control of.

Here's and example.

<pre><code>public class Foo : TcpClient
{
	public void Connect()
	{
		/* ... */
		base.Connect(host, port);
	}
}
</code></pre>

I would like and expect it to expose <samp>Foo.Connect()</samp> first, then possibly <samp>TcpClient.Connect()</samp> second. For that matter, I'd like to tell it to ifnore the base class entirely.

This is what really get's exposed via the CCW:

<pre><code>Connect(host, port)	/* This is the TcpClient.Connect() /*
Connect_1()		/* This is Foo.Connect()
</code></pre>

Not quite what I want, or need.

<strong>Got this on figured out too. Using <code>[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)]</code> on the class forces the CCW to expose the component by it's interfaces. Of course, that means you have to use interface implimentation/inheritence. :-) Now the only problem is figureing out how to specify what interfaces to expose while hiding others (aka <samp>IDisposable</samp>).</strong>

Now, for the next problem. <kbd>Regasm</kbd> also generates both methods in a overload situation.

<pre><code>public class Foo
{
	public void Read(uint length)
	{
		/* ... */
		Read(length, true);
	}
	
	public void Read(uint length, bool block)
	{
	
	}
}
</code></pre>

This is what gets exposed in the CCW:

<pre><code>Read(length)
Read_1(length, block)
</code></pre>

What I'd like to have it do is ignore the first public method and only expose the second method. At the very worst, let me reverse the names. The second method is the one that needs to be exposed to COM.

Who wanted to write code for <code>myObj.Read_1</code>? That sucks big time, especially if you're trying to mimic the API from an old piece of software where the <code>Read_1</code> method is the same as the old API version of <code>Read</code>.

<strong>Looks like I have the overloading problems solved via <code>[ComVisible(false)]</code></strong>

Now, I know there are a buttload of attributes for use within <samp>System.Runtime.InteropServices</samp>. For example, I have to include <code>[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.AutoDual)]</code> in my class definition so the CCW would work for early and late binding.

So, any CCW/InteropServices gurus out there willing to share some wisdom?

I don't know why it took me so long to try it, but in an effort to make something useful out of the .NET inline XML documentation I downloaded <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/">NDoc</a> and turned it loose on the assmembly I've been workng on.

Holy cow! 30 seconds later I've damn nice compiled /chm help file. That's awesome. I'll have to spend some time cleaning it up and filling in the missing parts, but I don't think API documentation could be much easier.

IT can generate any number of different documentation formats too. Check out their <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/reference/">online docs</a> built using their own tool. Nice.

I've <em>finally</em> "finshed" a project. By finished I mean the NUnit tests were written, the C# code completed, and the compiled HTML help documentation is done.

I haven't been able to do that in...yeah: <strong>NEVER</strong>, at least not at work. That's why I turned it into a skunkworks project at home so I could complete software to the level I wanted it to be at.

Go figure.

No, let's see if I can do the same with that website -&gt; mod_perl conversion project I've been sitting on forever.

It to the point now that a few of my Norton AntiVirus 2002/2003 installs subscriptions' are set to expire. I've heard bad things about NAV 2004; things like it has MS like activation, and that is sucks up more resource than the older versions.

So, I figure it's time to snag some new AV software. I've had bad experiences in the past with McAfee, but I hear version 7/8 is pretty good.

There's also TrendMicro and Panda. I want something that works and paying $49 for Norton AV is a retarded price anymore.

What do you use on Windows?

I can highly recommend KAV (Kaspersky Antivirus, from www.kasperskylabs.com) as a lean, mean, virus killing machine!

However, it's best to go on something a little more objective than personal preference, so see here:

I usually consider spammers as the scum of the Earth, but I recently realized they have a meatspace counterpart: ambulance chasers.

Last week, some old nut rearended Margeaux at the circle (more on that later). It was a slow impact, noone was hurt, and the bumper barely showed a scratch.

Ever since then, she has gotten anywhere from 2-6 letters a day from lawyers and chiropractors. Fucking losers. I have no confidence in, nor would I ever give my business to people who have to resort to getting their customers that way. That shit should be illegal.

One chiropractor went so far as to leave a message on our answering machine, assumedly using the phone number on the police report.

If it were me, I would send a very nasty reponse to all of those people and along with a copy to the Better Business Bureau and maybe the State's Attourney General letting them know what I think of their ambulance chasing ways.

As for the "circle", Tallmadge has the most <a href="/blog/images/wtf/tallmadgecircle.gif">retarded center of town</a>, it's no wonder there are accidents there all the time.

Ok, this is such a small thing, but it underscores why I really wislike windows sometimes.

I'm in the process of installing perl 5.005_03, 5.6.1, and 5.8.4 on my laptop running XP. I have the installers. Everything installed fine. Life is good.

Now, I need to install <samp>DBI</samp> and <samp>Class::DBI</samp> for the project I'm working one. Under 5.6.1 and 5.8.4 it's easy using <kbd>ppm install DBI</kbd> and I get pretty new versions of both of those. Under 5.005, the only available version of DBI is 1.14. That's not going to do. In order to get an updated version from CPAN, I'd have to install my own. This means needing to compile the XS modules files as well.

Now, where's the only place on Earth you can get the needed <kbd>cl.exe</kbd>? <strong>By purchasing Visual C++</strong>. Thanks but no thanks.

I can understand charging for an IDE, but for the love of all that is holy MS, please release the cl.exe for all to use. Hell, I can download the VB.NET and C# compilers and the SDK. How about fessing up with some of the old C++ stuff?

Don't give me the "Preview Release" excuse either. They've ALL been preview releases. I did a clean install of 1.0PR and it has assloads of problems; most of them related to bookmarks.  Specifically, mine disappear every time I reload the browser.

The extensions updates code or site appears to be retarded as well. I tried installing BugMeNot 0.6 and it failed the install saying it would only work on 0.7-0.9, even though it was listed as working under 0.10. I went to the BugMeNot site and installed it from their just fine.

I really wish this 1.0PR didn't get so much publicity. Everyone is going to think Firefox sucks, when in reality it's been pretty darn good up until now.

Our tests of firefox pr 1 for OS X were similarly disappointing. We were able to auto detect some feeds but subscribed feeds did not stick after restarting the app. Once feeds were subscribed, attempting to open the bookmarks menu would cause the app to crash. This was repeated many times successively.

Was also slow as a dog and we could hear the processor and drives grinding away as soon as we launched the app. Were assuming (hoping) the performance and bugginess will be taken care of by the time 1.0 is finalized.

That said, 0.9.3 is an amazing browser and PR 1 looks to be even better if they can address these problems. IE/Safari/Opera look out!

No problems with my bookmarks here.  I would have to 2nd the complaint of Firefox 1.0PR being dog slow.  There is a noticable performance hit compared to 0.9.3  However, I do like the live bookmark implementation of RSS.  I like not having to fire up yet another app to read feeds.  It seems Firefox 1.0PR wants to see a content-type tag set to the feed type (rss, xml, atom).  Not all sites that have feeds have this.  Hopefully they'll fix the performance issues fairly soon. In the meantime I just may go back to 0.9.3

I had a bookmarks disappear problem as well.  What happened was that I had the Sage extension installed and everything worked fine.  I decided to remove Sage and after I restarted the browser, my bookmarks were gone as well as the bookmark toolbar.  I then went to the Bookmarks->Manage Bookmarks and saw all my bookmarks were still there.  I then exited and my bookmarks showed up from the Bookmarks dropdown list but toolbar was still missing.  I then re-installed Sage and now I have my bookmarks back.

Hi there, I had thought Firefox 1.0PR had broken the BugMeNot extension also but then I saw that the extension (in version 0.6) made a UI change around the same time as the 1.0PR release.

Now BugMeNot only shows up in the Firefox Right Click Context Menu if you put your mouse pointer over a username/password field.

So it was there and working fine but I took some time to notice it.

It seems to work fine, but shortly thereafter, it started getting jittery and finally hung. Restarts yielded no disc/no drive errors in WinDVD.

I took out the DVD and sure enough, the frigging drive borked my disc! I now has rings around the outside diameter of the disc. Like a dumbass, I tried another DVD thinking that one was already scratched and it did the same damn thing.

At this point, it's obvious that this drive is a dead piece of junk. It still reads CDs fine. There's no way I'm putting in my UT2K4 DVD to load the game.

Luckily, I've got a DiscDr I can use to de-scratch the DVDs.

This is always a fun problem to track down. Part of a DTS package I worked on had this problem where it converted 'New York' to 'NE' instead of 'NY' using a table full of state abbreviations. Once I found out where this problem was, I'm even more mystified at what the problem really is.

Within the SQL Designer for creating Lookup queries in DTS, I created the following query:

<pre><code>SELECT
	RTRIM(UPPER(Abbreviation)) AS State
FROM
	States
WHERE
	(Name = ?) OR
	(Abbreviation = ?)</code></pre>

This yielded <strong>two</strong> results: NE amd NY. So there's where the error occurred. Now for the shitty part.

I take the same query and run it in SQL Analyzer like so:

<pre><code>SELECT
	RTRIM(UPPER(Abbreviation)) AS State
FROM
	States
WHERE
	(Name = 'New York') OR
	(Abbreviation = 'New York')</code></pre>

and of course, it returns <strong>one</strong> result: NY.

I don't know what in the hell paramaterized queries do in the background within DTS, but I don't like it.

In the end, I just ended up cheating:

<pre><code>SELECT
	RTRIM(UPPER(Abbreviation)) AS State
FROM
	States
WHERE
	(Name = ?) OR
	(CAST(Abbreviation AS VARCHAR(50)) = ?)</code></pre>

Apparantly I felt the need to waste my weekend creating a custom XP installaton CD.

<img src="/blog/images/microshaft/freshinstall.png" alt="RunOnceEx Window" title="THis will make Reboot, Reformat, Reinstall a lot quicker!" />

While it's not perfect, it at least installs ATI, Audigy2 and wireless drivers along with .NET 1.1, .NET SP1, Firefix, Thunderbird, WMP10, Textpad and NUnit 2.2.

It's all down hill from there. I got a chuckle out of the fact that my box has an assload of network in it; 3COM GB, 3C905, MN-730 Wireless, and IP on the two firewire ports.

Also for the curious, you can find a boatload of unattended/slipstreaming information at the <a href="http://unattended.msfn.org/">Unattended XP CD</a> website.

Keep this in mind though, regardless of some of the examples, <strong>always keep all of your files in 8.3 format</strong>.

No for my complaints. What is up with Microsoft and hardware drivers? It's Service Pack 2. It's late 2004. Many motherboards are shipping with built in 3Com Gigabit ports. Many many motherboards are shipping with onboard Promise FastTrak RAID/SATA controllers.

For god sake, at least include drivers for your own stinking wireless network cards. Geez.

My initial reaction to Firefox 10.PR was that it sucks serious ass compared to 0.9.3. I'd like to ammend those sentiments.

My bigest complaint was the bookmarks that wouldn't work, and that disappeared every time I restarted Firefox. That problem has been resolved.

I run Firefox from a USB thumb drive using the <samp>-Profile</samp> argument; installed from the .zip version, not the .exe installer.

It appears that in this configuration, the import wizard never runs, and as such, never creates a <samp>bookmarks.html</samp> and <samp>bookmarks.bak</samp> file. If I manually added <samp>bookmarks.html</samp> to the profile directory, Firefox would delete it every time I quit Firefox.

The secret seemed to be to let Firefox run normally and create a local profile. Then copy it's <samp>boomkmarks.*</samp> files into my portable profile. Problem solved.

I guess Firefox looks for a <samp>bookmarks.bak</samp> and assume the if it isn't there, the import wizard never ran, wipe the file and start fresh.

Who knows.

I'm sure I'll catch some shit for this if it gets published in the local rag, but what the hell. Everyone around me hears me bitch about it, so why not spread my gripe around town.

<blockquote>

Tallmadge School Needs Sight-Unseen

The Mrs. and I have been residents of Tallmadge for just under a year now. She is a nurse at Akron Childrens Hospital and I graduated college with a BA in Music Education. We currently have no children but are both very supportive of the ideals that children are a top priority and the education environment must be strong.

With that said, I won't be voting for the school bond issue this year. I have two main reasons that prevent me from being on board with this issue.

First, it has not been proven to me that a new school is needed. A report or two and a few official public statements has not solidified need, but has proven only want. If the city wants to convince it's residents that a new school is needed, how about having an open house? Show me the things that need repairs. Show me the things that are decaying or need fixing. I think everyone would feel much more confident about the reasons why we need a new school [and paying for it] if they could see the problems with their own eyes.

Second, I question the priorities concerning the school needs over this past year. I know there are certain laws and restrictions on how city, state, sale, and property taxes can be used, but I have to seriously question the urgency in the need of new schools when we just built a new recreation center. If our children are so important, I think we should've spent that money on building or repairs for a school rather than on a new rec center. To me, this was no better than Cleveland building a new football stadium while the ceilings in their schools are falling in.

Christopher Laco
Tallmadge

</blockquote>

And yes, I'll admit it. I don't want my property taxes to increase either. Not after every other tax under the sun has gone up due to fed money cuts.

As a techno-shmuck wage slave competing with outsourced Indian technicians for $12/hr with no benefits, I'm with Chris on this.  Under Bush's healthcare plan I get squat!  Bush's plan 'allows small businesses to band together to lower healthcare costs'....sheeeeit!  In Ohio we've been ahead of the prez for years...it's called COSE, and if it was so great, my employer would've joined.  Kerry's got the right idea on this one.  Also, Kerry is just a tad more concerned about civil liberties than the president.  Kerry acknowledged along with the Congressional Republican leadership that the Patriot Act need to be fixed with regards to civil liberties.  Bush, as is characteristic, refused to even acknowledge that there is a problem...'I hope you don't think that the Patriot Act and Patriot Act II weakens civil liberties - they don't'...give me a break!  Kerry's got my vote.

It seems to be indexing for me okay so far. I don't think it is indexing Firefox either. I don't have Thunderbird on this computer, so I can't test that. We do have to remember it is beta, and they may add those in later. We should all put in a request so it gets done.

I'm not a gun owner and probably never will be, but I'm all for people having them. While talking election choices with a coworker, he educated me on how the asault weapons ban was useless and how all the hype about W letting it expire is bullshit.

It goes something like this. When passing the law to make anti-gun people happy, the definition of assault weapons was changed [and I'm paraphrasing here] to be

<blockquote>

"...any firearm with <strong>more than 2</strong> of the following characteristics: threaded barrel for silencer/flash surpressor, bayonette knob for mounting a bayonette, more than 5/15 round clip semi or full auto for hand/rifle, and a hand grip stock instead of the rifle like shoulder stock"; or an AK-47 (Avtomat Kalashnikova model 1947)..."

</blockquote>

So what happens when the law went into effect? Well, the company changed their name and the gun name to WASR-10.

<pre><code>AK-47 != WASR-10</code></pre>

Not only that, but the company removed the threading since silencers and flash supressors have been banned for years and the bayonette mount.

So, that leaves us with a WASR-10 what has (1) the hand grip, and (2) the automtic with 15+ clip. That's 2 characteristic of the "assault weapon" definition, but not <strong>more than 2</strong> characteristics.

So what does this really mean? The assault weapons ban that just expired meant jack shit. You can, and always could run down to your local bullet shop and purchase a WASR-10. Even more so, any stistics about less violence or deaths due to ban on assault weapons is a complete crock of shit.

In this case, W did the right thing. Let the worthless ban expire so they can try and push through a ban with a better definition of "assault weapon". Any election FUD about the ban expiring is just that FUD.

Just goes to show you that people making those kinds of law don't know what the fuck they're doing.

I've had the itch for a while now to upgrade all of the antivirus software in the house, but I refuse to give Symantec any more money. They're the Microsoft of the AV world. The stuff keeps getting slower and more expensive. In a time where viri and spyware/adware are running rampant, $50 per machine is way too much for AV software.

I used AVG version 6, the free version, for a while. It's ok, but it doesn't catch a lot of things, and even then, it won't remove half of them.

After searching and reading reviews, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.bitdefender.com/bd/site/products.php?p_id=2">BitDefender 8.0 Standard Edition</a>. Not only is it <a href="http://www.anti-virus-software-review.com/bitdefender-review.html">highly  rated</a>, but it's only $29.95. Even better, it gets cheaper the more you buy! I got 4 copies for $67.08! Kick ass! Better yet, every renewal comes at %50 off for existing customers, so next year I pay $33.54 for 4 computers!

Not only is it good software, but the price kicks ass for securing a 4 computer household.

It certainly is a lot better and less intrusive than a damn popup find box withint applications. I think Office could stand to learn the find bar trick too.

The Firefox team could make the find bar even better by searching the content of the page AND the content of the text/input boxes in the page.

It's things like this that make people wonder. Mom just told me that the local newspaper said one of the recent tax issues was passed with xxx for and 0 against. Zero against. She said she knows at least five people who voted against it.

That kind of makes you wander how many times this happens and how many votes are lost. Now multiple that thought with electronic votings machines with no paper trail.

<blockquote>

JACKSONVILLE, N.C. - More than 4,500 votes have been lost in one North Carolina county because officials believed a computer that stored ballots electronically could hold more data than it did. Scattered other problems may change results in races around the state.

</blockquote>

It gets better.

<blockquote>

 Officials said 3,005 early votes were stored, but 4,530 were lost.

<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=519&amp;e=3&amp;u=/ap/evolution_debate">This book disclaimer</a> is a complete piece of bullshit.

<blockquote>

ATLANTA - A trial opened Monday over whether a warning sticker in suburban Atlanta biology textbooks that says evolution is "a theory, not a fact" violates the separation of church and state by promoting religion.... The sticker reads, "This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered."

</blockquote>

Why the fuck do tho bible nuts get their own fucking sticker? I'll let them have that sticker, as long as they put this on the bible:

<blockquote>

"This textbook contains material on a super duper invisible man in the sky. God is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered."

</blockquote>

Shit like this really pisses me off. It's just like those jacknuts trying to force schools to teach creationism. Fine. I'll teach creationism in school of you teach evolution in bible school. That will never happen so why should we have to teach creationism? It's called S C I E N C E class for a fucking reason.

Hey, if it's ok for you to push your shit in schools so "children get a well rounded education", then let's be fair and push the other stuff in church. That would never fly, so why is this tolerated?

Hell, if a certain group of Americans can get a Black Cultural Center on campus at my expense I'm sure, then why can't I have a White Cultural Center on campus? What about a Mexican Cultural Center? Why is one more acceptable than the other? Politically correct is fucking out of hand in this country.

Don't get me wrong. Believe what you want, just don't force it on me or others.

<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=710&amp;e=1&amp;u=/usatoday/druggistsrefusetogiveoutpill">Another entry</a> into the bullshit train. I understand the argument, but I still call bullshit. Do your fucking job and fill the Dr. ordered perscription. There are plenty of reasons women take these bills OTHER than just to prevent pregnancy; aka hormone regulation.

<blockquote>

For a year, Julee Lacey stopped in a CVS pharmacy near her home in a Fort Worth suburb to get refills of her birth-control pills. Then one day last March, the pharmacist refused to fill Lacey's prescription because she did not believe in birth control... Some pharmacists, however, disagree and refuse on moral grounds to fill prescriptions for contraceptives. And states from Rhode Island to Washington have proposed laws that would protect such decisions.

Mississippi enacted a sweeping statute that went into effect in July that allows health care providers, including pharmacists, to not participate in procedures that go against their conscience. South Dakota and Arkansas already had laws that protect a pharmacist's right to refuse to dispense medicines. Ten other states considered similar bills this year.

</blockquote>

Do what the customer is paying you to do, or you're fired. Leave you're bible at the door for this one. You're paid to dispense pr<strong>e</strong>scribed drugs, not pr<strong>o</strong>scribed drugs. Do so, or get the fuck out.

Yet another example of political correctness gone too damn far.

While I'm on a roll, here's <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=558&amp;e=14&amp;u=/ap/scotus_assisted_suicide">another one</a> for the bullshit meter.

<blockquote>

WASHINGTON - The Bush administration asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to block the nation's only law allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients die more quickly.

Oregon voters approved the law and since 1998 more than 170 people have used it to end their lives. Most had cancer.

The Bush administration has argued that assisted suicide is not a "legitimate medical purpose" and that doctors take an oath to heal patients, not help them die. 

 Oregon's law, known as the Death With Dignity Act, lets patients with less than six months to live request a lethal dose of drugs after two doctors confirm the diagnosis and determine the person's mental competence to make the request.

</blockquote>

First, as Margeaux pointed out not so long ago, why in the hell do we treat dying pets better than dying humans? If a pet is ailing without home of survival or a cure, we put them  to sleep without a second though instead of letting them suffer. Why in the hell we do this for ourselves?

Second, don't shit me GW. This doesn't have dick squat to do with the Hipocratic oath. It has everything to do with religion.

Dear Government, stay the fuck out of my life unless taxes are paying for it. Last I checked, I was paying the insurance that was paying for the Dr. The decision is mine, not yours so fuck off.

Thank you. Drive through.

BODY:
This kind of stuff makes my eyes bleed. For the last 2 week, I've been aggrivated off and on with randomly slow DNS lookups. This was really apparent when my DSL was upgrade to the 3MB package. Everything <em>should</em> be blazingly fast but it just didn't feel right. I hadn't had the time to look at it.

St. Murphy forced my hand at work today. I needed to add a new zone and upon rebooting all DNS servers I was greeted with errors about bogus root name servers on the hints file and no queries were being resolved.

Fine. I downloaded the lates from Internic and slapped it in and restarted Bind. Sure enough the errors went away and the A and K root servers had changed. However, no queries were being resolved. Then mysteriously after about 10 minutes, queries were resolving. Damn strange.

After beeting my head against the wall, I found some posts on Google about Bind >= 8.3.3 haveing new EDNS support, and this support being flaky and sometime slow or impossible behind certain firewalls.

Not only that, but one of the posts also mentiond trouble resolving certain yahoo.com addresses; another problem I was having with news.yahoo.com.

So, the 10 minute dead time was apparently happenging due to failed EDNS requests to the ROOT A server. Nice. The damn root servers don't even support the damn protocols all the way.

Then I added any entry into the config the each root server:

<pre><code>server 198.41.0.4 { edns no; };
server 192.228.79.201 { edns no; };
server 128.8.10.90 { edns no; };
server 192.203.230.10 { edns no; };
server 192.5.5.241 { edns no; };
server 192.112.36.4 { edns no; };
server 128.63.2.53 { edns no; };
server 192.36.148.17 { edns no; };
server 192.58.128.30 { edns no; };
server 193.0.14.129  { edns no; };
server 198.32.64.12 { edns no; };
server 202.12.27.33 { edns no; };</code></pre>

Whola! After another restart of Bind, they all now resolved queries right away. I'll still need to update them to Bind9 to keep it from crapping out on individual servers who use EDNS.

After for the situation at home. I just did the same trick (I'm already on Bind9) and resolving names seems a whole lost faster.

Heavy sigh. Finally.

This is going around the email channels. It gave me a chuckle. Also, take a look at <a href="http://www.fuckthesouth.com/">fuckthesouth.com</a> while you're at it.

<blockquote>

Dear President Bush:

Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from you and understand why you would propose and support a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. As you said, ''in the eyes of God marriage is based between a man and a woman.'' When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination... End of debate.

I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of God's Laws and how to follow them.

1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?

2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?

3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanness - Lev.15: 19-24. The problem is how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.

4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is, my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?

5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?

6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there 'degrees' of abomination?

7. Lev.21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room here?

8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?

9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?

10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev.19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair, like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)

I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.

BODY:
So we all went to the mall (or Mizall) yesterday for lunch. THey just happen to have a GameStop right by the food court, so I snagged a copy of Half-Life 2: Collectors Edition; hereafter known as HL2CE. HL2CE comes on DVD and contains HL2, HL1, HL1 Counter Strike, a HL2 T-shirt, and a mini Prima strategy guide.

I had already heard rumors that even the retail version of HL2 required an "internet connection" for activation. I suffered through that every time I installed or reinstalled XP Pro, so how bad could it be? Pretty bad apparently. From the looks of all the net feedback around the HL2 release, I don't appear to be the only one that dislikes their attempt and online delivery and authentication of gaming.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
First, a little tangent about Steam and "Steam Powered" games. Steam is an online content delivery and DRM system which appears to allow one to download the encrypted source file to a game. One creates a Steam user account and registers CD keys with Steam or purchased keys online. Once that is done, Steam unencrypts the source files and allows you to play the game; sort of. When unencrypted, these source files are still packed in a virtual file system within single files that still rely on the login and authentication to Steam to run. Hence, the required internet connection. This is what runs most people. "I bought the damn game, let me play it when I see fit and away from the internet or when the Steam servers are down."

The first step was easy. Pop in the DVD and it installs Steam, then it installed the source files to HL1, HL1: Counter Strike, and HL2.

Now the shitty user experience begins. The next step is creating a Steam user account. This fails oodles and oodles of times with Winsock errors. Fucking great. All I could keep thinking was how I was going to go to bed pissed about not being able to play a $70 game that I just "bought". Then it dawned on me to disable the firewall in XP SP2. That did the trick, but the real question is why in the hell didn't Steam trigger the XP Firewall Exception popup question like all other applications that try to access the net for the first time?

I went to the Steam FAQ pages, and the list of questions and answers there are completely unacceptable for an end user who purchased a retail copy. If you don't have net access, you're screwed. If you only have HTTP/HTTP/FTP proxy access to the net [AKA, college], you're screwed. If your CD key is already in use even though you just bought the game, you're screwed. If you're behind a NAT or firewall, you're screwed. Now granted, most basic firewall/NAT situations will work, the amount of ports you're forced to open is retarded. Hell, <strong>every internet connected home computer should be behind a firewall and probably NAT!</strong> At least make the Steam shit work over a proxy. #$%^%$#@

Ok, so now I can connect to steam and start to create an account. Every other question and Next button yields a "Remote host forcibly closed the connection" Winsock errors, which means their shit is getting pounded. Once again this points out the fact that if their servers are not up, the DVD I just bought is a fucking expensive coaster.

To add insult to injury, Once I finally added my CD keycode for authentication, it kept barking that authentication could not be processed to busy servers and it would finish the request later. At least it lets me play the damn game already on my hard drive.

In a nutshell, I just spent over an hour fucking around with Steam just to get the game I just bought playable. That leaves a damn sour taste in my mouth, and I'd really think twice about every buying a Steam powered game again.

Now, on to gameplay. The game itself kicks ass. THe graphics are awesome and so are the physics. THe video setup allowed me to choose my aspect ration and my resolution, so I have no problems getting a full screen 1920x1200 resolution. Even with all the options on High, the game play is almost always jitter free.

This game does have some serious flaws thus far. First, the initial load time and the load times between checkpoints are way too long, anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute plus. This is on a 3.4Ghz 1GB dual PCC3700 ram machine with RAID-0 striped 10k SATA drives. AKA, it's not the hardware.

Another bad thing, when in full screen mode, if anything in XP kicks off a taskbar notification, like say the wireless internet signal getting lost or such, the game freaks the hell out and forces you to restart it. I haven't tried running the game in windowed mode, but they certainly need to work on it.

All in all, the jury is still out on this one. I like the gameplay and the storyline, but I think Steam has a looong way to go before it can be considered an acceptable user experience.

I'm glad I decided to take adopt a few <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~claco/">CPAN modules</a>.

More importantly, it's gotten me back in programming mode at home instead of just sit on my ass mode.

Along those lings, I'm thinking about an upgrade to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> from CVS. I don't do enough major things with CVS to need to upgrade to Subversion, but I think I like Subversions anon web access better than CVS. It sucks to run a copy of Apache2 to do it, but what the hell.

Anyone out there got and experience with sharing anon CVS over the web vs. anon sharing of SVN?

Either way, at least I have TortoiseCVS and TortoiseSVN.

Just a few notes this evening about things that bug me today. First, the fucking Blockbuster "No More Late Fees" commercials. They're bullshit. The fees haven't went away, they've just increased. Now after a week you pay for the whole damn movie replacement cost. Of course, all the idiot comsumers won't realise it.

Second, I bought the extra large bottles of RealLemon lemon juice at Sams Club. They're a complete fraud. They are watered down. When I make lemonaide, it takes two cups of the lemon juice from the smaller bottles. When using the bigger bottles, it take three. That means these bastards ate watering it down and charging more money. Fraud if you ask me.

That is all.

I'm trying to compile versions of libxml2, XML::LibXML, libxslt, XML::LibXSLT, and AxKit-1.62 on windows. It's a friggin impossible task.

I'll get libxml2 to compile, then XML::LibXML won't compile, even against a known good version in the README. I'll try another version, then libxml2 and XML::LibXML will compile, then libxslt will look for header files not in that version of libxml2.

Rinse, Lather, and Repeat. How does anyone ever get anything working in C/VC++ on Windows? Thank god for Perl of C#. No headers. No symbols. When errors occur I can actually troubleshoot them.

The last 3 weeks have been like that show "Connections" where the British dude relates the length of toothpicks to the building of the first atomic bomb; seemingly unrelated.

I was happily writing TDD test for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Handel&amp;mode=distribution">Handel</a> when I needed to upgrade AxKit. Only 1.61 was available for win32, so I begged Randy Kobes to build 1.62.

Once he had done that, libxslt/libxml started crashing apache since they were upgraded to newer versions as well. So now it was time to figure out how to build my own.

A week later, after begging Randy for even more hints and help, I finally managed to squeak out new versions of libxml, libxslt, their XML:: counterparts, and AxKit 1.62.

Now, back to writing tests. Hey, why not another distraction or two? Let's put FreeBSD on the laptop so I can run my tests there too. After another couple days of tinkering, I've finally got the sound working, the wireless working, and KDE 3.3.2 actually runs. Using it to post right now.

Boy has KDE gotten a lot better since 3.0!

As if that wasn't enough, I converted a couple other modules to SVN and uploaded new versions to CPAN, along with getting CPANPLUS/Test::Reporter running so I can post test reports to cpan-testers.

I finally got a few release versions of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Handel&amp;mode=distribution">Handel</a> out the door complete with an assload of tests including the XSP taglib tests. I also included a small cart demo in AxKit/XSP. It's not feature complete, but it's start.

I got bored last night and decided to install <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Template-Toolkit&amp;mode=distribution">Template Toolkit 2</a> for the first time. After getting <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Apache::Template&amp;mode=distribution">Apache::Template</a> installedas well, I set about the task of writing Template::Plugins for Handel along with a sister demo site built in TT2.

As soon as I get that done I can kick version 0.04 out the door.

And of course, I need to finish/fix this damn site; at least the stylesheets...

Ever have one of those ideas that just popped into your head at 6am and you just can't shake it? I had one of those this morning. The scary part is, I think it could be done by a non-writer like me given time.

My thought was to create a Friday Five book; about 400-500 pages; covering the top 20/25 people from 20 or so categories like sports, actors, writers, politics, technology, etc. I would pick 5 questions I think everyone would like to know about famous people and get to work.

I'm not a writer. Hell, I can barely type anything other than code, and my spelling is horrible. I wouldn't know where to begin. But the fact that I <em>could</em> do it is appealing.

For those who don't know what the Friday Five is, it's a set of five questions you answer about yourself on a Friday.

I know this is old school for hardcore Perlheads, but I just learned how to use <samp>tie</samp> in perl.

While adding a generic config reader to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search/?mode=dist&amp;query=Handel">Handel</a>, I thought it would be nice to have the native config instance work just like using <samp>Apache::ModuleConfig</samp> does when using custom directives.

<pre>my $cfg = Apache::ModuleConfig->get($r);
my $setting = $cfg->{'Setting'};</pre>

The old config reader looks in two places for configuration. When running under mod_perl, it used <samp>$r->dir_config</samp> to get things set using <samp>PerlSetVar</samp>, otherwise it looks in the regular old <samp>%ENV</samp>.

With a little <samp>tie</samp> magic and an overridden <samp>FETCH</samp> method, I now have:

<pre>my $cfg = Handel::ConfigReader->new();
my $setting = $cfg->{'Setting'};</pre>

And since it's a tied into Handel::ConfigReader, I can still use the previous method:

<pre>my $cfg = Handel::ConfigReader->new();
my $setting = $cfg->get('Setting', 'DefaultValue');</pre>

Not bad for a music guy.

I heard this on the local readio this morning. Apparently Microsoft is suing a Kent State student for buying the "student discounted" software and reselling it on Ebay.

Now, if he did this with hundreds of copies (I'm pretty sure he can only get one), that's one thing. However, if he did this with one copy, this is bullshit. I don't care what and damn EULA says. The doctrine of first sale applies. It's his copy. He bought it. He can resell it.

Hell, if I get an OEM version with a new harddrive, can I sell it on Ebay, along with that hard drive? You bet your ass I can.

Here's where the monoply tax kicks in. Even if this guy was 100% within his rights and everyone knew that, he'll still lose. Microsoft can afford 4 layers. He as an average person cannot.

<img src="/blog/images/games/hl2.gif" alt=""/>

Even though <a href="/blog/archives/entries/new_gaming_rig.icf">my current gaming rig</a> is going on two years old, it still kicks ass. A 2.4 overclocked to 3.3 on air cooling doesn't suck, and the memory throughput with the OCZ dual channel kicks ass, even by most of todays benchmarks.

From the day I installed Half-Life<sup>2</sup> I've gotting memory errors of some sort. What pissed me off even more about that was the fact that Memtest86 shows the memory is clean as a whistle.

Last night I had the urge to play HL2 again and once again, the random crash pissed me off. Admitting my wrongness and leaving behind "but it shouldn't happen" thoughts, I dropped my FSB down 15 points. I'm still overclocked to a respectable 3.18.

No more crashes [yet]. Sigh.

With that said, playing HL2 is just as much fin, and just as scary the second time around. That dan game is very immersive.

Scratching another itch while adding currency conversion to AxKit::XSP::Currency and Handel.

This is a lightweight module to do currency conversion using the Curency Convertor web service at http://www.webservicex.net/.

The motivation for this module was many fold. First, Finance::Currency::Convert with Finance::Quote was a little too bulky for my needs, esp the need to download or maintain conversion tables. Finance::Currency::Convert::Yahoo seemed to be based on screen scraping. Way to fragile for my taste. Finance::Currency::Convert::XE has usage restrictions from XE.com.

I'm filing this under humor because that's the only explanation I can come up with thus far.

Long story longer. When we moved into our new house in November 2003, I signed up for the Deluxe-S DSL package from SBC. After a slight installation schedule snafu everything was up and running. Packets went out; SBC bills came in.

In November 2004, my 1 year long DSL contract was up for renewal. On top of that, the Deluxe-S packaged had been replaced by a faster and cheaper Pro-S package. So, I called in on November 4th, and signed up for another year along with the upgrade into the Pro-S package.

Like all things SBC DSL, they managed to accidentally make a duplicate PPPoE profile for my account which promply gave me a new static IP block. Needless to say that screwed things up for a weekend. After a phone call, it was fixed and my upgrade was completed.

Now for the fun part. :-) Since November 4th, 2004, I have yet to receive any billing for DSL. It's up. It's running. It's in their system. No one seems to be able to figure out why I'm not getting billed. Here it is, month 5 of free DSL. Every month I call in. Every month I here 'Should be getting a bill next month'.

I did find out that if they fix it and back bill me, their max back bill interval is 3 months.

<strong>Hey SBC, take as long as you need to fix the problem</strong>. :-)

I hate beans. I love hot sauce. Enter beanless chili.

  - 2 lbs. 90% ground beef
  - 2 lbs of beef stew cubes
  - 3 29oz cans of tomato sauce
  - 1 23oz bottle of Franks RedHot
  - 2 tblspoons of minced garlic
  - 2 large spanish onions
  - 3 Jalapenos
  - 2 green belle peppers
  - 2 red belle peppers
  - 1-2 orange/yellow belle peppers (if you want to tone down the hot)

Dice the first onion. Put it in the pot with the ground beef and cook away. While that is cooking, dice the beef stew cubes. When that's done, put it in the pot with the ground beef and cook away.

Deseed the jalapenos and put them in the the beef. Same goes for all of the belle peppers. Cook until everything is done.

After all of the contents are cooked. dice and add the second onion and garlic. Add the tomato sauce, the entire bottle of Franks RedHot and about 4 cups of water. Add in some dried mustard. Boil until the sauce thickens then bring it down to low.

Eat away. Have the antacids handy. :-)

This case is really aggrivating me as of late. Here's exactly how I feel about it.

First, Congress and that tard Jeb have no right, <strong>no right</strong> to get involved, especially with these bullshit tactics they're pulling today in Congress. When the judges have ruled already, they need to stay the fuck out of it. Period.

All of a sudden these pricks care and pull an emergency session? What the fuck? They're never in a damn hurry to do any other damn thing for the people like jobs, food, and money. DOn't get involved now.

Now, for the issue at hand.

First of all, her parents need to stay the fuck out of it as well. Once she got married, her husband is the decision maker, not them. Period. That is one of the reasons have to get married now a days is to ensure who the primary care decision maker is. It's too bad for them that they don't agree with their son in law, but that's just the way it has to be. They can't be allowed to thwart his legal right to make the decisions.

Second, I understand the issue about removing the feeding tube. I admitedly feel a little quirky about that. If she were unconcious and they were removing the <em>breathing</em> tube, I would have no qualms about it. Technically, yes, his decisions is startving her to death. I personally couldn't make that decision for a stranger.

However, I dare you to find one damn person who is apposed to this this action who would <em>truthfully</em> want to live in the permant state she is in. I wouldn't. Let me die. And I couldn't let Margo live that way either if she didn't wish to.

Let us no forget one very fucking important fact, that according to her doctors she is in a <strong>persistent vegetative state with no hope of recovery</strong>. Read that again: <strong><em>persistent vegetative state with no hope of recovery</em></strong>.

There are those who say that Michael just wants the million dollar malpractice award and to marry his long time girlfriend. I call bullshit on that.

First, after 15 years worth of medical bills and now this court stuff, there is no more million dollars. Second, of course he wants to move on. If he was so evil, he could've divorced her and taken the money and gotten remarried. But he hasn't.

Why? Because maybe he really is trying to carry out his wifes wishes, and we all need to stay the fuck out of it.

I think most people on either side are missing two important facts:

First, she is in a persistant vegitative state as declared by many doctors and the Fl courts.

Second, as her husband, her legal guardian, he is doing nothing illegal by removing her feeding tube according to current law. If it were illegal, neither the nurses nor doctors would do it and he would be charged with a crime.

With those two things in hand, the courts, the goverment, the PRESIDENT, and even her parents need to stay out of it. Period. Regardless of what you may or may not think about him, or how you feel about her state.

Now for what really irks me. In many states, they passed a supposed ban on gay marriage that also screwed up many rights of non-married couples, calling into question the legality of living and regular wills and power of attorney between non married hetero couples. So their answer is "get married then". Fine.

Now legal guardianship and power of atty. is going to end up unenforcable and worthless because of actions like this from the government when it's not their place.

This is especially true if the forms are seperate but some content/layout and considering that XHTML 1.0 Strict/1.1 are pissy about what can and can't be put in forms, and where form tags can happen.

With that said, ASP.NET 2.0 and the new VS.NET Web Developer Express are pretty damn cool compared to the past versions.

Things like this try my sanity. Not that I get all worked up about it, but because I just was so unfocused in routine to truly decypher the events unfolding.

While in Cleveland we decided to stop at Carrabas for dinner. After sufficiently stuffing our pie holes with dinner, the plates were cleared, the bill brought, and the debit card submitted to the waitress for bill payment.

The bill and it's leather carrying case rearrive during which time MArgo and I are chatting about lord knows what. I sign the bill. Then, like I always do before I leave places like this, I recheck my wallet to make sure I have returned my debit card to its proper location.

Lo and behold it was not there. I searched the wallet, the table, my pockets, my jacket, the floor. Nowhere. It must have never found its way back to me or it would be on my person or at the table.

No big deal really. Call and cancel the old, and wait for the new card. It just bugs me that I don't remember for sure that it did not come back with the bill.

I must say, after all the crap with the last version of Splinter Cell; the crappy patches, the crashes, the corrupt profile issues; this new version is actually great.

On top of that, it's cheap too. $30-$40. That's great compared to friggin Half-Life<sup>2</sup> and Doom<sup>3</sup> that were above $50 when they were released.

I had to turn down all the featuresto get 1920x1200 playable. Time for an X800 XT PE or X850 XT PE. I think Margo would kill me. :-)

There are two things in the programming world which I despise; things that no programmer should ever have to do with modern tools; things that would surely qualify as levels of hell in Dantes Inferno.

<strong>UTC/Local Time Conversions</strong>. Even in some modern databases, getting native local dates out the door into UTC in a proper format is pain in the ass. Understanding it is even worse. On top of that, when you go through the hassle and a friggin external entity chokes because it thinks the Z in the date string for Zulu time is invalid; which it's not according to the RFC.

<strong>Unicode/Encoding/CodePage Conversions</strong>. God please smite the person at HP who thought creating their own ANSI codepage was a good idea (HP Roman8). Then smite Microsoft for not including it on windows even after the include every flipping codepage from EBCDIC to all of the IBM variations. Nice job guys. Now I have to write my own Encoding class.

"Two rings of programmers hell. The two rings of programmer hell are UTC time conversion and text encodings/codepages and low level encryption. Three! Our three rings of programmer hell..."

Apparently it wasn't just enough to figure out how to create a .NET encoding for HPROMAN8. Today I spent time figuring out how to do dynamic encryption in COM of the cart data being posted to PayPal.

Most of their examples had nothing to do with .NET, ASP.NET, ASP, COM, or even VB/VBScript with the exception of a ButtonEncryptionLib in [apparently] managed C in .NET.

After a day of tinkering, I finally got OpenSSL compiled and the ButtonEncryptionLib compiled against it producing a .NET assembly. From there I just had to create a CCW [Com Callable Wrapper] and whola! Dynamic button encryption within ASP. :-)

Tomorrow it's back to hacking perl and trying to stop playing damn games all the time on the new vid card.

After <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.qa/3889">starting</a> a big crapstorm on the <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.qa">perl-qa list</a> about <samp>META.yml</samp> generation in <samp>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</samp> vs. <samp>Module::Build</samp>, and Schwerns following <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.qa/3914">rant</a> about <samp>Module::Build</samp>, I decided to eat the dog food I've created and convert to using <samp>Module::Build</samp> and <samp>Build.PL</samp>.

Minutes after starting I had issues with my dists that were based on <samp>Apache::Test</samp>. When running <samp>perl Build test</samp> I would be in an endless loop of A::T asking where <samp>Apache.exe</samp> was. That info was already in <samp>Apache/TestConfigData.pm</samp> and worked just fine under <samp>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</samp> and <samp>Makefile.PL</samp>.

After a couple weeks of ignoring the problem and a few hours of frustration this evening, I finally found the problems. Yes, two problems not just one.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
First, under <samp>Makefile.PL</samp>, we have these two lines:

<pre>$build->generate_script('t/TEST');
$build->generate_script('t/SMOKE');</pre>

This generates <samp>t/TEST</samp> and <samp>t/SMOKE</samp>, and calling <samp>make test</samp> always ran <samp>t/TEST</samp>.

Now under <samp>Build.PL</samp>, those same two lines also created <samp>t/TEST</samp> and <samp>t/SMOKE</samp>, but running <samp>perl Build test</samp> trys to run <samp>t/SMOKE</samp> as the test script. That's the first problem. To further illustrate the issue this code:

<pre>$build->generate_script('t/TEST');
$build->generate_script('t/SMOKE');
$build->generate_script('t/POOP');</pre>

would cause <samp>perl Build test</samp> to try and run <samp>t/POOP</samp> as the apache test script.

This leads me two the second problem [but the first symptom]. This sequence:

<pre>perl Makefile.PL
perl t/TEST
perl t/SMOKE</pre>

works just fine. <samp>TestConfigData.pm</samp> is read and everyone is happy. However:

<pre>perl Makefile.PL
perl t/SMOKE</pre>

fails with the "where's apache" loop. It appears that <samp>t/TEST</samp> autogenerates <samp>t/conf/apache_test_config.pm</samp> while <samp>t/SMOKE</samp> does not. So, for now, <samp>t/SMOKE</samp> requires that <samp>t/TEST</samp> runs at least once before it.

As for the solution, changing the <samp>Build.PL</samp> to:

<pre>$build->generate_script('t/SMOKE');
$build->generate_script('t/TEST');</pre>

solves the current problem. It's not clear which version of <samp>generate_script (TestMM.pm vs. TestMB.pm)</samp> is correct or whether the config autogen behavour is really missing from <samp>t/SMOKE (TestSmoke.pm)</samp> or if that is by design.

My trash company is funny. If I don't put trash out, they call me while they're holding up traffic in front of my house.

Last night it was raining and crappy. I've got 5 trash cans and had only two bags of trash (1 can worth). I had no desire to bother taking the trash to the curb in the rain.

This morning, they called me again. "This is Republic Waste Services. We noticed you didn't put any trash out this week. We'll get it all for you next week.".  As apposed to?

I wonder if there's some trash quota they need to meet and I'm throwing them off? :-)

Part of my wants to be annoyed about them calling. The other half of me is amused that they do and that they even notice or care that I have no trash.

The <a href="http://www.nrcc.org/">National Republican Congressional Committee</a> is apparently telemarketing whois data for donations and committee victims.

Twice now I've gotten a phone call from the NRCC at work about being an honerary chairman at an event with my Congresscritter, and also getting a signed gavel and hat with  donation of $300 or more.

The recorded messages are the usual crap about me being a small business leader and attending the event , taxes, hardship, replublicans fixing it, yada yada. They were started and followed by dialog from scripted humans.

The first time I hung up. This time when they called, I let it all play out and then when the human came on I basically asked "Why in the hell are you calling me to be a chairperson?". I'm just a joe in a cube with a computer.

Then she said that she had me listed as "business xyz". Yeah, the only place I'm connected with that business is via whois and a domain name registration where I'm the admin/tech contact. Asshats.

If it weren't for the fact that it could give business xyz a bad name and I loath politics, I should've let it play out all the way and totally become the heckler at the event. :-)

Life at home without a laptop is a bitch. I'm used to programming AND watching tv downstairs. I'm crazy like that. I need to sets of sensory input to keep me busy. Programming upstairs on the desktop isn't happening. That machine was built for gaming and there's no tv in my office. :-)

We were originally going to get hitched in D.C., but the licence requires a 5 day waiting period and a blood test. Get real. So we're going to pop over to Maryland which old requires a 3 day waiting period. We've got a nice spot on the bay for a couple of hours.

I'm kind of pissed that the Revenge Of The Sith game isn't getting a PC version. LucasArts is sadly lacking when it comes to a Jedi-based First Person Shooter. 

Jedi Academy is long in the tooth compared to HL2 and DOOM3. Battlefront and Battlefront 2... bah. I hate Real Time Strategy games. Republic Commando...not Jedi related. I wouldn't touch Galaxies with a ten foot pole.

I sure their FPS space doesn't stay empty for too long.

I really enjoyed JK2 and KOTOR and would have LOVED to see some other "quality games" come out of LA but unfortunately, George doesn't give a crap about the PC gamers. For him, the money is in Consoles ESPECIALLY, with all of the latest stuff coming out, he can easily "pick and choose" which platform he wants to develop for. He is a powerful guy that has a lot of leverage within the community as a whole.

p.s Congrats on getting "hitched".

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. The man is an idiot. GW quoth yesterday on tv "and the children here today remind us that there is no such thing as a spare embryo".

Has he never been educated to how fertalization clinics and invetro fertalization works? They create many many "spares" in hopes that at least one implanted will be successful. THe rest are thrown away. Yes, thrown away, or "killed" in the religous rights mind. But of course, none of them are out against fertalization for people who really want children are they? Or course not.

There is no reason under the sun that those should not be used for reasearch. It is not "destroying life to save life" since they're already being disposed of.

Now, tell that loved one of yours that "sorry, while we could cure your paralysis if treated right away but we can't because of the religous nuts". It <strong>is</strong> happening oversees right now in places that aren't as screwed up as we are. There <strong>are</strong> people who have had their paralysis <strong>reversed</strong> with new treatments. It's medical fact and documented in medical journals.

This is why religon is no better than politics any more. Religon was supposed to be a agenda free. Now, it's no better than politics. Mr 51% Mandate can't leave soon enough in 2008.

What's even more amusing is that implantation results in about a 65% chance of failure.  So by insisting that we do not use the embroys for stem cell research because it's not natural to kill them, he insinuates that the moral thing to do would be to implant them.  In other words, immediately kill 65% of them that could've been used for research.  He's retarded.

...happen within 5 miles of the home. Yeah no shit. So we drive 11 hours to Canada, and 11 hours back without event. Sure as shit, we hit a deer 3 exits from home on the freeway. Son of a bitch.

Fortunately, no one was hurt and the deer didn't come through the windshield. That would've been bad news at 55-65MPH on the freeway.

Poor Perl. The front end is a mess, but I doubt they would total it since it's a 2003 and still has good resale. I don't trust cars once they're wrecked. I may just let it be fixed and trade it in on another new or semi new Maxima since this one is already paid off.

We'll see. I didn't think to get pictures even though I have my digital with me. Maybe tomorrow. Speaking of pictures, I have some Canada fishing pictures to put up. Maybe tomorrow as well.

Hola from our nations capitol, Washington D.C. We're in town for a nurses conference, our wedding and the 4th of July! What a week. 

We left after work yesterday and got here about midnight. All in all, it's been a wonderfully pleasant trip so far.

We got here late enough that they gave our rooms away (despite us calling them and telling them we would be late). So they upgraded us to a full out suite! Kick Ass! No only that, but we're getting the suite at the discount rate we were getting for the regular room: $139. Shaaawing.

<p class="center">

</p>

We got up early and made our way to Annapolis to get our marriage license right downtwon on the circle at the courthouse. In MD you have to get the license from the same county you're getting married in. How strange for a state license. On top of that, they asked for no drivers license of birth certificates. At least the asked us if we were related.

<p class="center">
<img alt="license.jpg" src="/blog/images/offtopic/dc/license.jpg/license.jpg" width="568" height="426" />
</p>

Then we made our way down to Herrington on the BAy in Friendship, MD. to check out where we're having the wedding. It's on the wedding lawn right on the water. Very very nice view.

</p>
<p>
<img alt="waterfall.jpg" src="/blog/images/offtopic/dc/waterfall.jpg" width="568" height="426" />
</p>

After a late lunch and a trip back through downtosn D.C. to the hotel, it's nappy time, then on to dinner. The traffic wasn't nearly as bad as I suspected.

Tomorrows plan: Monument Hopping.
Fridays plan: Museaum Hopping.

Thing are moving along quite nicely on the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Handel/">Handel</a> front. Version 0.18 is out and considered feature complete in terms of tests, checkout, order, and carts in Perl, on AxKit and within Template Toolkit. I need to start on a Catalyst demo site as well.

There is a nice crisp new <a href="http://lists.rawmode.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/handel/">mailing list</a>. I need to setup a wiki and the subversion repo on the new <a href="http://handelframework.com">domain name</a>. This means I need Apache2 installed, which means I want to install mod_perl2 which means I need a newer version of perl. Oh yea, I need to upgrade MySql to version 4.

Considering all of that work, I've decided that it's best to give this web server The Big Wipe and start from a scratch FreeBSD 5.4-RELEASE install. Then I can let Apache1/MP1 and Apache2/MP2 fight it out. After that, maybe PHP4/PHP5, or at least PHP4 under both apache installs. You get the idea.

I've long wanted to convert everything from 3 1U servers back into one to make life [and my electric bill] much happier. If I start from scratch on this machine, eventually it will become the one and only.

If it weren't for AxKit, and me wanting to run the Handel AxKit demo online, I'd ditch Apache/MP1 all together. Hell, I might as well upgrade MovableType, or maybe even ditch it for WordPress?

So, after some quick and dirty backups of SQL data, DNS files, config files, and websites, we will be off the air for a while.

Hopefully I can can this all done by the end of the weekend. Famous last word right?

Keep your stick on the ice and out of your friends face. We're all in  this together.

First, let me say that there are many vastly improved things in ASP.NET 2.0 and Visual Studio (Express) 2005 to be praised. Master pages. SQL dependency caching. XHTML output. The list goes on and on.

There is one thing in ASP.NET 2.0/Studio that really chaps my ass: the SQLDataSource control. You see, back in 1.1, when you dragged a table from the server explorer into your web form, a SQLConnection and SQLDataAdapter were created for you. Way cool. All of the code it created got put into the pages codebehind file.

In 2.0, this SQLDataSource control stuffs a load of HTML server-side tag goop into your HTML...things like connection strings, stored procedure parameter declarations, etc. I call bullshit on that action. It defeats the purpose of codebehind and seperation of code/content.

Sure, you can still program against the SQLConnector/SQLDataAdapter directly, but people who code using the toolbox controls are out of luck: it's either crap in your HTML, or start writing code. This seems like a big step backwords in 2.0.

Apparently, I'm not alone. These links get the the heart of the problem:

After two days of tinkering, I finally got one of my many wireless cards working under the Ubuntu 5.2 Hoary Hedgehog Live CD.

And what took so long? THe format of the WEP key. Here's a tip for the wireless config developers: give examples! IT won't work with AABBCCDDEEFF, but it does work with AABB-CCDD-EEFF because that's what it's expecting.

Even better, put those in yourself if the user doesn't. Don't make it any more harder for the user than you have too.

Now, I think I might just wipe FreeBSD off the lappy and give a real install a try. THat would give me another test platform since I'll still have FreeBSD on the servers.

Now, I just need an iBook to complete the test farm. ;-)

Dave Winer posted <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/10/12#When:12:00:54PM">this output</a> about how OpenDocument:

<blockquote>
After years of maintaining absolute control over user's data in Microsoft Office, the new version promises to give total control to the user, and creates a path for developers to siphon users from Microsoft to new or specialized products. One would think that this would spawn an explosion of new products designed to please Office users but that's not what's happening. A group of large technology companies is proposing a competing set of formats, and has formed an alliance to confuse the market, and at least double the work of any developer who might want to support their products (with almost no installed base) alongside Microsoft's (with a monopolistic dominant installed base).
</blockquote>

Hold on there Dave. Last time I checked, the OpenDocument format specs used by OpenOffice/StartOffice/KOffice, etc were around long before Microsoft tried being 'open' and opening the office formats unto XML. It is Microsoft who chose to create a second standard for office document formats, not the OpenDocument people.

I do hereby declare that the <samp>for:user</samp> tags, and the <samp>/for/user</samp> pages on del.icio.us are completely useless and broken.

I caught the <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> buzz late, just last month late. Better late than never though. One of the features that intrigued me was the <samp>for:</samp> tag...the ability to send bookmarks to other people, and the ability to view bookmarks sent to you by goind to <a href="http://del.icio.us/for/claco">/for/claco</a>. Great. Sounds fun. Too bad it doesn't work.

Two weeks ago, a friend sent me my first bookmark. When I went to my "for" page, it never showed up. After poking around, I finally noticed that it was in the private RSS feed, but not in the page. I sent an email to support, but didn't get anywhere.

Now, two weeks later, I had 2 people send me 3 more bookmarks. As soon as they did, the first bookmark from two weeks ago showed up on the for page immedately. As of today, non of the new bookmarks have appeared on the for page, but they are all in the private RSS feed.

What the hell is going on there?

I've sent support another email, but I don't have high hopes, and the online help for the "for" functionality is pretty slim.

BODY:
So we had a big scare this weekend. Over the last couple of months, we've been trying to change our eating habits just a little...a little less crap, and a lot more veggies. We started out Friday with the chopping of the veggies for stir fry. We've both gotten fond of Thai stir fry. I like the hot basil stuffs, and she likes the coconut/peanut sauce stuff.

After we got done eating, Margo jumped up, ran upstairs and screamed call 911. As I called 911, she was chewing up Benadryl like they were tick tacks. She was having a major allerigic reation and her throat was closing fast. Once they ambulance got there, they took her to the hospital where she spent the night.

We know she's allergic to seafood, iodine, and penicillin. We don't know yet if this was a cross contamination issue (fish products made in the same place the peanut sauce is made), or if her body has just decided that she is now allergic to peanuts. She'll be having an allergy test in a couple of weeks. She's fine for the most part, although her throat is still irritated and she appears to be having some small relapses. Supposedly it can take at least 6 days for allergins like that to be purged from the body completely.

But back to my point, why my wife is a better person than I am. She's a giver. She says I am too, but I treat stress differently than she does. If it were me and I kept feeling scared and like it was still happening again every day, she would see me through it. I, on the other hand, do something stupid: I start to get angry. Not at her, but at the fact that I can't do anything to change the situation, or that I'm afraid to deal with the stress again, so I want to just act like it's not happening.

God knows why she puts up with me sometimes.

BODY:
The man needs to go. Period. The lies keep flowing.

<blockquote><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usiraqweaponstrailer">WASHINGTON (AFP)</a> - The George W. Bush administration insisted publicly that two trailers captured in
Iraq were evidence of a banned weapons program, months after
Pentagon experts had reportedly ruled otherwise.</blockquote>

So, he knew what he told us wasn't true. This is just another instance of the crap we keep getting from this administration. Just like the Plume affair. HE full out said that leaking would not be tolerated, and the person needed to be found... but the person was him. Even if he does have the right to de-classify information on the fly, he know who leaked it, but played it off.

One top of that, more stupidity:

<blockquote><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/security_congress_dubai_dc">Reuters</a> - A U.S. lawmaker on Tuesday fumed that the Bush administration refused to divulge anything about a security review it is conducting of a Dubai-owned company that is planning to take over several plants in the U.S. that make equipment for defense contractors.</blockquote>

Great, more secrecy. And file this one under "What the hell is the point":

<blockquote><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060412/ap_on_go_co/immigration">AP</a> - The two top Republicans in Congress, confronted with internal party divisions as well as large public demonstrations, said Tuesday they intend to pass immigration legislation that does not subject illegal immigrants to prosecution as felons.</blockquote>

Brilliant idea folks. So the good people have to get a Visa to enter the country, but the people who sneak in... well, let's not even make that a crime. Great idea.

I want CLinton back. Sure, he lied about doinking some chick in his office. Who gives a shit. THe economy was good, weren't at wor (even though Congress never declared this a war),  and the goverment was spying on us left and right, pissing away our freedoms.

Tijm Bray over at ongoing <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/17/Take-Five">mentioned</a> the old classic Dave Brubeck tune Take Five. I never heard that he didn't write it, or even play the solo. Guess I was asleep that day in college. :-)

There's a version of Take Five in the wild in which the melody is still played in 5/4b but the core tune is in 4/4. To top that off, the 4/4 part of the tune is in Reggae style. I wish I could find that recording. It's been a long time since I've heard it myself. I do have the Take Five CD though. :-)

I like Ohio. I really do. No volcanoes, no hurricanes. Not to many poisoness animals. But when I see things <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060829/NEWS24/608290360/-1/NEWS">like this</a>, I begin to wonder what idiots are running this place:

<blockquote><p>
COLUMBUS - An Ohio legislative panel yesterday rubber-stamped an unprecedented process that would allow sex offenders to be publicly identified and tracked <strong>even if they've never been charged with a crime</strong>.</p>
<p>The person's name, address, and photograph would be placed on a new Internet database and <strong>the person would be subjected to the same registration and community notification requirements and restrictions on where he could live</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

What The Fuck. Not convicted? Restrictions on where they can live? What the hell is wrong with these people?

I hate shit like this. This is one of those topics that flips my rant bit quite harshly. I'm fine with putting Child Sexual Predators on a list. Fine. Parents want to know where they live. Fine. People want to keep them away from schools. Fine.

But for the love of all that is reasonable, every fucking state in the nation needs to properly define what a Sexual Offender is, and there not always child molestors. Everyone sees a name on a Sexual Offender list and assumes every person on it is a child molster.

Take, for example, that case of the guy who stalked and <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060416/maine_shootings_060416/20060417?hub=CTVNewsAt11">murdered two people in Maine</a> last year that were on a list. One WAS a child predator. The other  banged his under age girlfriend [asuming he was close to her age] and the parents caused a ruckass. That guy had no business being on that list. Hell, in some states, getting busted for public urination w/ your johnson hanging get's you on the Sexual Offenders list.

This bill and my retarded state just goes to prove my point. You're 30, poked your 16yo gf when you were 18. You got busted showing your dick in public while taking a piss on a drunk night. You don't deserve to be on this list, and harrased like a criminal because some asshat can't make understand the difference between sexual offenders, sexual predators, and sexual child predators..let alone the fact that you are not a convicted criminal, so you can't be treated like one.

Rant mode off.

I'm holding out for MacBooks with the new Core 2 Duo chips, and I hope that happens next week. The day it does, I'll drop the dime on a new order. If they're putting them in the low end iMacs, they almost have to put them in all of the low end computers, especially laptops. Everyone else in the industry is at this point.

I'm playing a game with St. Murphy. The file server at home is an old dual P2666 Tyan 4U server with a 4 disk RAID5 running an ancient version of FreeBSD. "Morpheus" has served us well, but it's had a degraded RAID5 for about 2 years. Yes. Two (2) years, with faithful backups of the important directories.

To make matters more entertaining, it has started rebooting at random, which always leads to the need for human intervention and a good ole run of fsck. So, it's time. Luck is running out. While you can buy single drive NAS boxes just about anywhere, not many have on that supports drive mirroring for under $1000. Then this came along:

<a title="2-Bay Network Storage Enclosure - DNS-323 by D-Link" href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=509">2-Bay Network Storage Enclosure - DNS-323 by D-Link</a>

I have that and two 200GB Seagate SATA drives on order. This weekend should be entertaining.

In our previous episode, I mentioned that I was getting a <a title="D-Link DNS-323 NAS" href="/blog/archives/entries/dlink_dns323_nas.icf">D-Link DNS-323 NAS</a> to replace a wonky RAID5 file server at home. It arrived Friday and the comedy trail of errors began.

As prescribed, I placed the 200GB SATA drives in the unit, plugged it into the network and powered it on. Once I fired up the Easy Search utility I was greeted with nothing. Nada. Zip. The utility didn't see the unit. This didn't surprise me really since I run DHCP at home that isn't the standard 192.168.0.x used in all of these consumer devices. Once I logged into the DHCP server and got the units IP address, I was off to the races.

The unit shipped with the 1.0 firmware which is junk at best. First on the list was to update to the 1.02b version. After uploading the new firmware, the update progress page never really indicated that it was done. At some point, I just assumed it was and rebooted the unit.

The next order of business was to configure the drives for RAID1. Once I did so and got the formatting process page, it kept freezing at 94%. Eventually, I assumed this 'feature' was just a glitch and the format was complete, and rebooted the unit.

Once I configured some users and shares, it was time to start copying files to the unit. Right out of the gate I started getting "Network name no longer available" and "File in use by another process" errors. Bummer. Not good things for a device you want to rely on to house your files.

After troubleshooting for a couple of days, I found out that the problem only occurred on my wireless connection, but not when I was directly connected to the unit. Eventually I stumbled across a KB article that mentioned that Windows File Sharing (SMB) gets really cranky if ICMP packets are blocked. Sure enough, my wireless connection settings had all of the ICMP stuff disabled. Once I turned that back on, things went much better, or so I thought.

I still had the occasional copy problem. This time, when the unit acted up, I went to the admin page interface. Instead of getting the D-Link page, I got my file server page. Like a dumb ass, apparently I assigned the NAS to a secondary IP my file server already had. Duh. Once I fixed that problem, the unit has been rock solid ever since.

So, aside from the owner bumbling, this unit has a great price point. At $200 for the unit, and another $100 for a couple of 200GB SATA drives for a unit that does RAID1 without all the power consumption of running a server is a no brainer.

Like most things, once I get an idea in my head, it quickly spirals out of control; or my wallet does. As my wife likes to say "Go for it. We have jobs". Margo is going to be in DC for the latter half of next week, so it seemed like a good time to make chili and have a good old fashioned game night. My laptop is getting old and won't play UT2K without overheating and rebooting any more. While I've got that kick ass 23" Apple Cinema Display and a NDivia 7800GT up stairs, hauling it and my tower downstairs and having to put the office back together afterwords is a pain in the ass. Then the downfall of ideas start.

Now that the old file server is powered off and we're running off the new NAS, I have a spare, albeit it large, 4U 19" rack mount chassis with a heap of 40GB IDE drives in it. I have a P4 3.0C proc, 1GB OZX PC3700 DDR Ram, and an ATI Radeon XT800PE all gathering dust after upgrading the desktop upstairs a few times. So all I need is a motherboard to put it all together. A few trips around eBay, and I manage to snag another Asus P4C800 Deluxe; exactly what's in the desktop upstairs. Since I made a slipstream XP install disk with the RAID and other drivers pre installed, This should be easy.

<em>Wait, I only have an old CD-ROM drive and I'm going to have to disk with DVD. Wonder how much those are.</em> <a title=" NEC Black 18X DVD+R 8X DVD+RW 8X DVD+R DL 18X DVD-R 6X DVD-RW 12X DVD-RAM 16X DVD-ROM 48X CD-R 32X CD-RW 48X CD-ROM 2M Cache E-IDE / ATAPI DVD Burner - OEM" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16827152076">$29.00</a> for a DVD that reads/writes most things. That's harmless I thought.

<em>I don't want to have to move the ACD and I have no spare speakers. Wonder how much a cheap LCD with speakers is.</em> <a title="Newegg.com - HannsG JW-199DPB Black 19&quot; 5ms DVI Widescreen LCD Monitor 300 cd/m2 700:1 Built in Speakers - Retail" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824254001">$174.99</a>. I could always use a cheap LCD to tote to game night. That's harmless I though.

<strong>Sigh</strong>. One NewEgg order later, I'll bet putting together the portable, not so small gamebox next week. Damn technology. I imagine at some point that my desktop will reverse merge itself into the 4U case and I'll eBay the spare parts. Go figure. The 4U chassis has a boatload of room in it as it housed 6 IDE drives, a CD Rom, Zip, etc. It's probably easier to work in than the tall Antec case I have is. I just hope I don't need to put in a bigger power supply.

Hardware creep at its finest. MAybe I'll toss on the new Ubuntu Feisty Fawn Beta if I have the time.

BODY:
Just out of curiosity, I installed <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/HomePage">SVK</a> on my laptop and started tinkering with it. For those not aware of it:

<blockquote><p>svk is a decentralized version control system built with the robust Subversion filesystem. It supports repository mirroring, disconnected operation, history-sensitive merging, and integrates with other version control systems, as well as popular visual merge tools.</p></blockquote>

Like most tinkering sessions of mine, I always end up stumped because I find some bug on the edge. In this case, it appears to be a date/time formatting issue on Win32 when changes are commit and pushed upstream.

Here's a sample message from a recent commit to local, pushed up to the mirror/master:

<blockquote><code>r118@np5660:  claco | 2007-03-25  Eastern Daylight Time</code></blockquote>

If it weren't for the missing time, it wouldn't be so bad. I would expect something more like this format, which is what I see on commits made by 1/x and non Win32 svk users:

<blockquote><code>r118@np5660:  claco | 2007-02-16 16:29:26 -0500</code></blockquote>

Curious. Then I finally thought to just try using the <kbd>log</kbd> command and compare both svn and svk:

<blockquote><pre>C:\Development\CPAN\Mango>svn log
http://svn.handelframework.com/CPAN/Mango/trunk/lib/Mango/Provider/Products.pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1784 | claco | 2007-03-25 01:37:32 -0400 (Sun, 25 Mar 2007) | 3 lines

r118@np5660: claco | 2007-03-25 Eastern Daylight Time
Added tags() to products provider</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>C:\Development\CPAN\Mango>svk log

----------------------------------------------------------------------
r119 (orig r1784): claco | 2007-03-25 Eastern Daylight Time

r118@np5660: claco | 2007-03-25 Eastern Daylight Time
Added tags() to products provider</pre></blockquote>

There's also this message in the Changes file for SVK:

<blockquote><pre>Use POSIX::strftime for date formatting rather than Date::Parse</pre></blockquote>

Yup. Something is definately afoot. Time to file an RT bug report and move on. Sigh.

<em>Twin Powers Activate. Form Of A P4C800-D Motherboard.</em>

The motherboard I purchased on eBay arrived today. The seller was quick and packaged the item extremely well. I'm quite happy with that since it was my first eBay purchase. The monitor should arrive Wednesday along with the DVD drive. Time to start putting the secondary game machine together. If I have enough working hard drives from the file server, I'll probably toss the latest Ubuntu beta on it just to see how it performs.

Hey Chris!

I was looking through my web server logs and noticed I got a couple of links from ya, specifically from your post here:
<a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/archives/entries/firstenergy_tail_of_woe.icf" rel="nofollow">http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/archives/entries/firstenergy_tail_of_woe.icf</a>

I'm just curious how/where I might know you from?  I honestly don't remember commenting that post before.  You seem like an interesting guy, I just can't place you...

It's been so long since STALKER was anounced, and postponed, and postponed, and postponed that I had never noticed that it actually came out. I snagged a copy at the evil Best Buy while I was out and about last night, along with a copy of Quicken 2007 since my 2004 CrippleWare won't do online crap after the 30th of the month. Sigh.

I was also checking one some of the new line of 17" Core2 laptops on the market. I hate HP craptops. I would never buy one again. The Toshiba Satellite 17"s look nice. My only beef is that the 105 Series has this insane narrow right shit key because they squeeze in a 10-key pad. Who the hell needs that. Totally worthless to me with a narrow shift key. Sames goes for keywords whom move the backslash key, or narrow the backspace key. Don't fuck with keyboard layouts please. It pisses off programmers.

Sam's Club of all people has a great deal on a Core2 17" Toshiba with 2GB DDR2 and a 120GB drive with Vista Premium for like $1200. That's a great deal with the exception of a close model of that on NewEgg.

I will says this for the overpriced 17" MacBook Pro: The keyword is full size. No narrowed key nonsense. To bad is only has one mouse button. :-P

The fonts render better. The wireless card worked out of the gate, which is a first. The network and other admin panels are much better. What an improvement. Way to go Ubuntu.

Just because I can. Upgrated MovableType to the new 4.0 [beta] version. Got it running under FastCGI just for giggles too. Almost had to. The 4.x version is noticeably slower than the 3.x version running under regular old cgi. FastCGI - not just a clever title. Installed memcached too just for giggles. Wonder how long it will be until the server goes boom. :-)

Of course, comments are broken. The one thing that MT gets wrong during upgrades are the templates. You can select exiting templates and choose 'refresh'..but that doesn't you do any good for templates that never existed, thus can't be selected. I've resorted to creating a new temp blog and coping all template records in the database into the existing blog.

Still working on Mango. Well, barely. I managed to waste a few weeks on Call of Duty, Call of Duty: United Offensive and Call of Duty 2. I usually like sci-fi games more than 'army' games, but CoD was pretty damn fun.

Long story longer. My good friend Ron from $work came over yesterday to help me setup the drumset. He, and my wife always prod me that I should start playing again, and honestly it's a good form of exercise; something I need but will never do.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/images/Drums%20003.icf" onclick="window.open('http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/images/Drums%20003.icf','popup','width=2272,height=1704,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/images/Drums 003-thumb-250x187.jpg" width="250" height="187" alt="Drums 003.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></span>

Well, the drums are setup but for the life of me I couldn't find the the power cord for the CD player for play-along sessions. Well, hey, it's the 21st century. Time to get something that I vowed to never get: an MP3 player. I'm not a big fan of the iPods, mostly because I'm just not into iTunes. I just want to drag my files over and have a go at it.

While I was at Wal-Mart, I got to look at the Samsung MP3 that I found online today. 2GB. FM. USB-stick sized and you just stick in the USB port and drag files over. It even supports Ogg. $80 later and I have one. Damn small. Damn nice. Way cool.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img alt="l_u3_img1.jpg" src="http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/images/l_u3_img1.jpg" width="254" height="403" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"/></span>

Game on. Oh yeah, there are 4 mores drums to that kit that aren't even setup. :-)

Once I decided on a bitrate vs. size that I could tolerate on this player, I've started ripping CDs and filling this little monster. Once of the cool features this player has is that I can alter the play speed, so I can play drums along with songs at half speed if I have to. Kinda cool. I've got about 10 CDs or so @ 96kbps, which works out to about 35MB per CD.

That bit rate sounds low compared to the VBR/320/nothing less than 128 mantra, but honestly, for most types of music, you just don't hear the difference on this kind of player. With a 2GB limit, it's all about how many songs I can cram on it before I regret not getting the 4GB version. :-)

Aside from the fact that she puts up with me, my wife is a saint in my book, and so are all the people she works with. You see, my wife works in pediatric palliative care.

<strong>palliative</strong>: (pl'-'tv, ---tv)
1. moderating pain or sorrow by making it easier to bear 
2. Relieving or soothing the symptoms of a disease or disorder without effecting a cure.

In other words, barring miracles, my wife works with children who are dying of something and they're usually not going to make it. Take yesterday for example. While I'm at home watching tv, surfing the internet and generally being lazy, she was at work tending to a family who had to let their son go. Imagine for a minute that you're the one who has to be there, watch them pull the plug, wait...wait...wait, and pronounce death.

That's heavy. She's a saint in my book. I don't have the intestinal fortitude nor the emotional rigor to deal with something like that...as a job: by choice.

Last night, Margo and I took Andrew [the nephew] and his gf to an Indians game. It's been about 10 years since I last went to a game a Jacobs field. Our seats kicked ass. Row AA, just left of home plate. Andrew was excited that Kenny Lofton was back in Cleveland this year. He wasn't scheduled to play, but around the 8th inning they brought him in to hit with bases loaded. He got walked for a run, and and the next line drive past first base brought in another 2 runs, from 3 down to a 3 over 8-5 win with a shutout inthe top of the 9th. Great game. That was a good time.

Not too long ago, Ohio passed a 'stripper bill' curtailing things like the distance between dancers and patrons, any form of contact, and halting nude dancing between midnight and 6am. That last one has me confused.

Isn't between 12am and 6am <em>exactly</em> when you want these typed of activities to happen? After curfews and all the kiddies should be indoors at home? That's why all the heavy stuff on tv is after kiddy bedtime. Seems completely backwards to me.

Aside from that, why the hell do we even need a law? If some schmoe wants to spend his money staring ad naked boobs in the middle of the morning, then so be it. Who cares otherwise. More laws that didn't need to be made.

Well, we finally planned it out and got our tickets ready for New Orleans the last week of December. Margo has to go for a nurses conference type thingy (technical term), so I decided to tag along. She won't step on a place without serious medication (fear of heights) and I just hate the airline industry in general. So, we're taking the train.

We have a 12 hour layover in Chicago which will be a nice chunk of time to run around town. First thing on the list: real UNO Deep Dish pizza. :-)

A nice long trip in a sleeper room with a picture window. I think it will be fun. Then of course, there's the 4 days in NOLA. Banas Foster is the top of the food list there.

Well, mostly. I've always wanted a MacBook Pro, but the price is a serious guilt trip and my 5 year old lappy was still going string...until tonight. When I went to open the lid, the hinges basicly exploded along with the case plastics around them. It literally won't survive another lid close/open.

It's a sign a tell ya. Without too much guilt, I ordered a reburbished 17" 1920x1200 7200rmp MBP from the Apple Store. It was $450 cheaper than a new one and has the same warranty. That price difference is just enough to pay for AppleCare, save $100 and feel just a little bit less guilty about the whole ordeal. :-)

Well, vacation time is finally here. We're off to New Orleans tomorrow night: by train. Yes, train is slower, and a tad more expensive, but it's relaxing. No need to stress out at the airport to and fro. Just a picture window, a camera, and a long trip.

We're staying at the newly rebuilt Hilton Riverside, which is basically at the lower left corner of the French Quarter.  She has a conference to attend and I have a list of things I plan on eating while I'm there. A spicy food lovers paradise.

I like MovableType. It's Perl. That's a plus for me. It keep getting better, and now there's MTOS. That's where my love stops.

First, the default templates combined with one of the 5 types of formatting for entries STILL yields non compliant XHTML, even within some of the templates themselves. Publishing is still too hard in that respect. It's 2008, and I still can't just plop in a paragraph or two and have awesome auto generated XHTML.

Their "4.1 supports FastCGI" is not very good support. mt-upgrade/check/xmlrpc still don't work under FastCGI, and it's so slow under normal cgi that it's still annoying. Again, it's 2008 and it still doesn't support mod_perl under Apache2. WordPress and PHP: Just Works.

This was a nail biter right up to the end. Even some of the very last hail mary passes in the last 60 seconds had a really good chance at putting the Patriots back on top. That's a good game in any book.

I make no attempt to hide the fact that I do .NET by day and Perl by night. I'll probably never do home projects in .NET, and I'll probably never do Perl projects at $work. Life is good like that.

At home, I use Catalyst, the best MVC framework for Perl. At work, I loathe ASP.NET and all of the hacking one has to do with its page lifecycle just to get some good combination if events, dynamic controls and control reuse. It's a slow form of torture in my book.

Much to my joy, The new ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions coming out have a nice shiny new ASP.NET MVC Framework, and it actually doesn't suck too bad. As such, I need to tinker with it and the code from work to see if it fits into our plan, breaking m lost fast rule about never working on $work code @ $home.

But I digress. One of the biggest problems Microsoft had in the past was that the development tools were too damn expensive for the home programmer. Lucky for us, they got wise and started release the "Express" editions of VB.NET and ASP.NET IDEs.

Sure, I have to do my core stuff in VB.NET Express, and then switch to ASP/NET Express to work on pages, and testing/source control isn't integrated.

Oh well, Thanks MS either way. Nice free powerful tools. Now you're starting to get it. :-)

BODY:
Today the Senate sold us out and approved a new FISA bill with immunity for the telcos. Apparently, giving the telecom industry immunity for breaking the law, at the request of the government, is more important than our rights to not be spied on. Let's be clear here. FISA worked. The President chose to ignore the law and the like of people like ATT chose to break the law. At least some people understood not breaking the law was a smart thing, like Qwest, who told the government to go pound salt. Let's not forget that the minute the government stopped paying its bills, ATT dropped their taps without nary a hint of hesitation.

##An Endless List

Now, we have telco immunity. Illegal wiretapping, on US citizens, not just foreign connections. Water-boarding. A new Attorneys General who refuses to even acknowledge that it's torture. Refuses to investigate water-boarding and wiretapping. Refuse to investigate and lay down the law on just about everything. We have Gitmo. Holding anyone we call a terrorist forever, without trial. Secret trials. CIA erasing tapes. Electronic voting machines that clearly don't work. Medial decisions being made by the insurance companies and not the doctors. The TSA/Borders copying peoples hard drives and hone lists. And that's all just the tip of the iceberg.

##When does it end?

This is country is going to shit, and it's apparently in a hurry from the looks of things. It's depressing at best. And to make things worse, not matter who we vote in, nothing changes. I personally think we're in for a future with one of three possibilities.

1. People rebel. Mass protests the likes of which we've never seen, to the point that entire industries shut down.

2. People revolt. The electronic way. The tech generation, the blog generation make like so difficult for old time news media that they have to put these issues on the front page day after day.

3. People vote. Early indications are that the youth vote is off the charts this year. This may end up with someone in office who is finally tired of all of the bullshit, and becomes a great leader, and a sever pain in the ass to Congress and Big Business.

##When I am King

Thus quoth Adam Carolla: When I am king:

1. Congress will no longer get free health care. Let them also feel the joys of rising premiums, denials for pre-existing conditions, and paperwork hell when the insurance company thinks it knows better than your doctor. Sure I'd prefer government guaranteed health care because, if it works for Congress, it can work for everyone, esp. children. But the spineless bastards won't even fund children, so that will never happen.

2. Paper ballots are mandatory. I take a pen, and mark a checkbox. That system worked or centuries and still works now. No dangling chads, no crashing voting machines. Every vote needs to count.

3. Everything that a public servant does on our time and our dime, needs to be open. No secrets. If you work for the taxpayer, you need to answer to the taxpayer. No sealed records. No executive privilege. No closed door hearings.

4. No more pork and hidden bills. Every bill is separate. No tying funding for one thing to approval for another. Every person in Congress must read what the are voting on. *EVERY* member must attend votes, and must vote yes or no.

5. Congress shall not be allowed to receive ANY money or gifts from any person other than their direct family (like xmas, bday), nor shall they be allowed to accept or earn any income other than what we the people, pay them to do their jobs. Yes, no stock options either.

6. No person, US citizen or otherwise, shall be held indefinitely by our government, without charges, without lawyers or without trials. Water-boarding IS torture and shall not be used. Ever. No exceptions. If it was good enough to convict a Japanese officer for using it on our troops, it's good enough for us not to be able to use it on anyone else now.

7. The US shall remove troops from foreign countries and mind our own fucking business for a change. No one is trying to bomb Norway are they? No. Because they mind their own fucking business. People want to bomb us now because we keep picking a side, sending weapons, abandoning that side, choosing another, sending weapons, then invading eventually leaving nothing but ruin while we sit back and suck down McDicks and Cokes and watch the Simpsons.. Rinse. Lather. Repeat.

8. The government shall hence forth stop being the copyright police and making laws to protect [failing] industries business models. I'm looking at you RIAA and the BSA. File lawsuits if you want. Take people to court. But stop buying our Congress just so you can get special treatment and laws. The FBI has more important things to do than execute your raids on someone selling bootleg CDs or someone reported to have unlicensed software. Other industries don't get to use the FBI as their personal police force and neither shall you. The government shall also stay the fuck out of sports investigations. It's sports. If someone's doping, it's the leagues problem. Get back to work.

9. The government shall put up or shut on nuclear issues. With all the money wasted on the Iraq war and all the rhetoric on Iran, we could've easily went into Iran and built them a nuclear power infrastructure, negating and worries and excuses of them making weapons just because they're researching enrichment. Be part of the solution, not the problem. If no one else should have WMDs, then neither should we. If we must have them for defense purpose, then so should everyone else. We weren't responsible when we invented them, so let's not inspect other fledgling countries to be that way either. IF you're worried about them using them to attack us, see rule #7.

10. Revoke the DMCA. No longer shall any industry be able to tell people what they can and can't do with products they've purchased as long as they are in their own homes.

11. Repeal *all* tax breaks for businesses. I can't get a 5 year no-tax break for moving into a city and neither should they. No longer shall the individual have to pay increasing taxes to cover the tax breaks of corporations.

12. Place a cap on severance, salary and options packages that CEOs receive. No longer shall corporate fat-cats get $35 million to leave a company that they just drove into the ground after firing 10,000 employees.

13. There is no such thing as executive privilege. You do what the law says. Period. See rule #3.

14. No government contracts shall be given on a no-bid basis, nor shall they be given to any company that the President, Vice President or any member of congress owns, used to own, or is on the board. Non of said contractors overseas shall be immune from prosecution, nor shall those case be dismissed as 'state secrets'.

That should do it for starters. :-)

##P.S.
Yes, I have ATT DSL. Like we actually have a choice. Thank you telco dereg act of 96; also worthless.

<blockquote>Today, the House has just approved H.Res. 982 by a vote of 223-32-1, which provides for the adoption of H.Res. 979, recommending that the House of Representatives find Harriet Miers, former White House Counsel, and Joshua Bolten, the White House Chief of Staff, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with subpoenas issued by the Judiciary Committee. These subpoenas were issued as part of the Committee's investigation into the firings of a number of United States Attorneys and matters concerning the politicization of the Justice Department. This resolution also provides for adoption of H.Res. 980 - Authorizing the Committee on the Judiciary to initiate or intervene in judicial proceedings to enforce certain subpoenas.</blockquote>

Now that the Democratic Senate has proved itself spineless, the House steps up. Finally, some contempt charges for people who don't testify. They also declinde doing anything with FISA, read Condi the riot act on WMD reports. Finally, that's what we want to see. Them not taking any more shit from this administration.

I got tired of using a corded mouse on he MBP, so I broke down and bought a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/notebook_products/mice/devices/143">Logitech V450</a>. It's not a bad little mouse. Not too small. Small dongle.

<a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/blog/images/2188.1.0.jpg"><img src="http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/blog/images/2188.1.0-thumb-250x166.jpg" width="250" height="166" alt="LogiechV450.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

I really wanted a Bluetooth mouse, but nobody carries them. Not Best Buy. Not Circuit City. Go figure.

A co-worker and I went to see Iron Man Friday. It totally kicked ass. I would put it on the same level as Batman Begins. I would definitely pay to see that again.

They also had a preview for the new Batman movie, which also looks kick ass.

	<title>MVC Marathon: Introduction</title>
</head>
	<body>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Over the last few years, I've spent a fair amount of time on the
			same projects, using the same tools, in the same languages. By
			day, I'm a mild mannered .NET programmer. By night, I fly the Perl
			flag, and spend a lot of time using Catalyst, one of the Perl
			based MVC frameworks. While I'm not abandoning those technologies,
			I think it's time for something new.
		</p>
		<p>
			They say you should learn a new programming language every year or
			so, and I'm long over due. Why not learn three languages at the
			same time to make up for lost time? :-)
		</p>
		
		<h2>The Challenge</h2>
		<p>
			The challenge is to build the same mvc application on all of the
			frameworks listed below. While I'm comfortable with Catalyst/Perl
			and ASP.NET, I'd like to be able to work on any project that comes
			along rather than simply answering "Sorry, I can't help. I don't
			program in that frameowork/language." I started my career as a
			Windows-only web programmer and over time, learned my way through
			FreeBSD, Apache, Perl and Catalyst.
		</p>
		<p>
			Will I be an 'expert' in Ruby or Python when I'm done? Surely not.
			But 3 years ago, I couldn't program in Perl either and 10 years
			ago, I could't even begin to get a *nix OS installed and
		configured to run Apache.
		</p>
		
		<h2>The Frameworks</h2>
		<p>
			For this adventure, I've picked what might be considered the most
			popular mvc framework for each language. These frameworks will be:
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC: Preview 3</a></h3>
		<p>
			While my day job includes programming in ASP.NET 2.0 WebForms and
			I have followed the MVC progress, I have not yet created an
			ASP.NET MVC app. Just to be a little more challenging, I will be
			doing this project in C# instead of the usual VB.NET that we use
			at work.
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP: 1.2RC2</a></h3>
		<p>
			I've read as much of the manual as I can at this point. This will
			be my first CakePHP application and my first PHP programming since
			PHP4 was released.
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst: 5.7</a></h3>
		<p>
			Catalyst is one of the many MVC frameworks written in Perl. I've
			been using Perl and Catalyst for about 3 years. While this could
			be my strongest framework, I'll be using none of my existing bag
			of tricks.
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django: 0.96</a></h3>
		<p>
			I've never written a single line of Python before. After looking
			at the Python and Ruby syntax on multiple occasions in the past,
			Python seems to be the language furthest from how my brain works
			now compared to Perl/C#.
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails: 2.1</a></h3>
		<p>
			Just like Django/Python, I've never written a line if Ruby in my
			life. I've been through the screen casts and sifted around a few
			articles and book excerpts. However, unlike Python, Ruby seems
			to fit how my brain works with Perl a littler cleaner.
		</p>

		<h2>The Application</h2>
		<p>
			I'm sick of the usual blog demo applications so I'm going to go
			with something a little closer to my heart. Those who know me know
			that I'm a big fan of hot food: If you don't sweat, it's not hot
			enough. So for this challenge, I'm going to build a site that
			tracks lists of restaurants and a list of menu items for each
			eatery hot dish.
		</p>
		<p>
			The application will be built in stages. Each stage will be built
			in every framework before moving on to the next step. After
			completing each stage, I'll post a new blog entry covering what
			code needed to be created in each framework and the pros and cons
			each framework provides. You can follow the source code progress
			in my subversion repository:

If you can keep all the variations of dialect straight enough to properly compare my hats off to you. Why not build the application once and complete in one framework, then pit that against another in the second round, winner progresses, etc etc.

For Rails I suggest that before you tackle a section, review the relevant RailsCasts.com (Ryan Bates) on that section. Also grab the WhatsNew in Rails 2.1 pdf (2nd Edition).

Good luck!

I chose to complete each step in all frameworks together is that I should be able to better compare each step across all frameworks. My fear with completing the project on one framework before moving to another was that I would forget my thoughts and grievances byt the time I moved on to a new framework.

I guess time will tell.

You should definitely replace django 0.96 with trunk.

I'll have to think about that. I am using the RC2 of CakePHP. My fear with trunk Django is that if I run into problrms, I might be in new territory. Whereas if I stick with .96, plenty of people have made it through that already.

Plus, I installed using fink on my MBP as I didn't want to fight any install issues...just get it all up an running asap.

I think you should more fear the fact that 0.96 is one year old and that plenty of enhancements have been made since. :-)

I guess most of the people currently working with django use trunk, and a lot of useful applications are based on django-trunk (e.g django-registration, django-evolution, etc...)

Anyway, good luck ;)

			Welcome to part 1 of <a href="/blog/mvc-marathon/">MVC Marathon</a>,

		<h2>Part 1: Creating a New Application</h2>
		<p>
			The first step in any new application is creating a directory
			structure and any necessary configuration files. Fortunately, most
			of the frameworks now a days provide ready made templates or
			scripts to make getting started as easy as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Today we'll explore how to create and run a new application in the
			various frameworks and explore the difference between them. You
			can jump to any specific framework using the links below. For this
			series of articles, I'm going to assume that you already have the
			basic frameworks installed.
		</p>

			<li><a href="#cakephp">CakePHP</a></li>
			<li><a href="#catalyst">Catalyst</a></li>
			<li><a href="#django">Django</a></li>
			<li><a href="#rails">Ruby on Rails</a></li>
			<li><a href="#conclusions">Conclusions</a></li>
		</ul>

		
		<h2><a name="aspnetmvc"></a>ASP.NET MVC</h2>
		<h3>Creating the Application</h3>
		<p>
			The easiest way to create a new ASP.NET MVC application is using
			the application templates in Visual Studio. To do that, simply
			select <kbd>File -> New -> Project</kbd>:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnetmvc-create.png">
				<img src='aspnetmvc-create.png' width="204" height="152" alt="aspnetmvc create" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the New Project window, select Visual C# as the
			language. Select the ASP.NET MVC Web Application, type in the name
			of the new application, in our case, BurningPlate and click OK.
			Visual Studio will create a new mvc application looking something
			like this:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnetmvc-create2.png">
				<img src='aspnetmvc-create2.png' width="204" height="152"  alt="aspnetmvc create" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Like nearly all MVC applications, we have the usual Controllers,
			Models and Views folders along with some other .NET specific
			folders.
		</p>
		<h3>Running the Application</h3>
		<p>
			To run your new application, simply hit <kbd>F5</kbd>, which will
			start the application in Visual Studios local web server. This
			means no messing with IIS until you have to. If all goes well, you
			should end up with the default home page:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnetmvc.png">
				<img src='aspnetmvc.png' width="204" height="152" alt="aspnetmvc run" />
			</a>
		</p>


		<h2><a name="cakephp"></a>CakePHP</h2>
		<p>
			There seems to be at least two ways to create a new CakePHP
			application. The blog example on the CakePHP website say to just
			download and extract the latest version and start creating your
			application in the <kbd>app</kbd> subfolder. This seems like a
			good approach if you're creating app to put on a server where you
			don't know or control the version or even if CakePHP is installed.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're running your own server, you can setup your env to point
			to a centralized install of CakePHP and use <kbd>cake</kbd> to
			create apps that reference the installed software. We'll do the
			latter as it closely follows how the other frameworks work.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the Application</h3>
		<p>
			First, let's see what <kbd>cake</kbd> tells us when we run it:
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon $ cake
Welcome to CakePHP v1.2.0.7296 RC2 Console
---------------------------------------------------------------
Current Paths:
 -app: mvc-marathon
 -working: /Users/claco/mvc-marathon
 -root: /Users/claco
 -core: /sw/cakephp/

Changing Paths:
your working path should be the same as your application path
to change your path use the &#x27;-app&#x27; param.
Example: -app relative/path/to/myapp or -app /absolute/path/to/myapp

Available Shells:

 vendors/shells/:
         - none

 cake/console/libs/:
         acl
         api
         bake
         console
         i18n
         schema
         testsuite

To run a command, type &#x27;cake shell_name [args]&#x27;
To get help on a specific command, type &#x27;cake shell_name help&#x27;</pre>

	<p>
		Next, let's run <kbd>cake bake help</kbd> to see what our options are:
	</p>
	<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon $ cake bake help
Welcome to CakePHP v1.2.0.7296 RC2 Console
---------------------------------------------------------------
App : mvc-marathon
Path: /Users/claco/mvc-marathon
---------------------------------------------------------------
CakePHP Bake:
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Bake script generates controllers, views and models for your application.
If run with no command line arguments, Bake guides the user through the class
creation process. You can customize the generation process by telling Bake
where different parts of your application are using command line arguments.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: cake bake &lt;command&gt; &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt;...
---------------------------------------------------------------
Params:
        -app &lt;path&gt; Absolute/Relative path to your app folder.

Commands:

        bake help
                shows this help message.

        bake all &lt;name&gt;
                bakes complete MVC. optional &lt;name&gt; of a Model

        bake project &lt;path&gt;
                bakes a new app folder in the path supplied
                or in current directory if no path is specified

        bake plugin &lt;name&gt;
                bakes a new plugin folder in the path supplied
                or in current directory if no path is specified.

        bake db_config
                bakes a database.php file in config directory.

        bake model
                bakes a model. run &#x27;bake model help&#x27; for more info

        bake view
                bakes views. run &#x27;bake view help&#x27; for more info

        bake controller
                bakes a controller. run &#x27;bake controller help&#x27; for more info</pre>
			<p>
				Since we're starting from scratch, let's give <kbd>project</kbd>
				a whirl:
			</p>
			<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/cakephp $ cake bake BurningPlate

		<h3>Running the Application</h3>
		<p>
			At first glance, there appears to be no development server for
			CakePHP applications. There is a script called
			<a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/the-cakephp-instaweb-webserver">cakephp-instaweb</a>
			available on the CakePHP website geared for this purpose.
			Ironically, the script relies on Python to get the job done. When
			I ran it, it appeared to work, but all I ever got when trying to
			hit it with the browser was a CGI SCript Error carping about
			headers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second option is to run this application under Apache. Since
			I'm on a MacBook Pro and OSX includes a running version of Apache
			and PHP, all I needed to do was place the BurningPlate directory
			in my Sites folder. After hitting
			<kbd>http://localhost/~claco/BurningPlate/</kbd> with my browser
			we get:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="cakephp.png">
				<img src='cakephp.png' width="204" height="152" alt="cakephp run" />
			</a>
		</p>



		<h2><a name="catalyst"></a>Catalyst</h2>
		<h3>Creating the Application</h3>
		<p>
			Just like CakePHP, Catalyst also has a command line utility for
			creating a new application. Let's see what what it has to say:
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/catalyst $ catalyst.pl
Usage:
    catalyst.pl [options] application-name

    &#x27;catalyst.pl&#x27; creates a skeleton for a new application, and allows you
    to upgrade the skeleton of your old application.

     Options:
       -force      don&#x27;t create a .new file where a file to be created exists
       -help       display this help and exit
       -makefile   only update Makefile.PL
       -scripts    only update helper scripts
       -short      use short names, M/V/C instead of Model/View/Controller.

     application-name must be a valid Perl module name and can include &quot;::&quot;, 
     which will be converted to &#x27;-&#x27; in the project name.


     Examples:
        catalyst.pl My::App
        catalyst.pl MyApp

     To upgrade your app to a new version of Catalyst:
        catalyst.pl -force -scripts MyApp</pre>
		<p>
			Looks like we just need an application name:

	<p>
		There weren't too many shockers here. For the most part, it's just a
		matter of running a command to get an application structure up and
		running. There are some areas that could use a few tweaks to help out
		the people new to their respective frameworks:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			CakePHP really could use a development server. For development,
			it's nice to not have to mess with Apache configs.
		</li>
		<li>
			Django needs to output something when it's successfully created
			a new application. No output equates to thinking nothing happened
			or that something is broken.
		</li>
		<li>
			Catalyst, Django and Rails would be a touch better if after they
			created the new applications would tell the user how to run them.
			i.e. "App created. please run xxx xxxx/xxxxx ro start your new
			app".
		</li>
		<li>
			All of the frameworks except for ASP.NET MVC tell the user where
			to go next and/or what files to start to configure. It would be
			nice if ASP.NET MVC did the ame thing rather than just display
			the "Home" page.
		</li>

Nah, django is the only one that gets it right.  The Unix philosophy is "no output means success".  The others are all achieving Java-like levels of verbosity.  :-)

Is there any reason you are using Django .96? All the documentation suggests that you use their SVN version (don't worry, quite stable) rather than using their soon-to-be replaced .9X series.

Re: 0.96

Because that's what fink curreny has and I didn't want to spend any more time than necessary installing and upgrading to non-release versions.

The only reason I'm using CakePHP 1.2 non-release that it's 0-install.

EXTENDED BODY:
		<h2>Part 2: Creating a Database and Model</h2>
		<p>
			Now that we have a bunch of shiny new applications, we need to add
			a database to store our data, and a model to get at the data. For
			this part of the project, I'm going to try and bypass the need
			to deal with mysql/postgres/mssql issues and go with the most
			simple database I can: SQLite. While there is an SQLite driver
			for .NET, it does not yet play well with LINQ, so in ASP.NET I'll
			be using SQL Server Express, which is part of the Studio install.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since BurningPlate is a website about restaurants peppery hot menu
			items, we're going to need a table to hold restaurant records. For
			now, the restaurants table needs only two fields: a record id and
			the name of the restaurant. The id field will be an auto-increment
			integer field and the name will be a 100 character field, both
			disallowing nulls.
		</p>
		<p>
			In general, there are at two distinct ways to go about creating a
			new database its models.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, all of the frameworks can simply be pointed at a database,
			told the name of tables and the models will inspect the schema and
			provide their own glue. In this scenario, the user is generally
			expected to alter the database, and have the model follow along. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The second method is really a reverse of the first. You create
			a schema in a generic language, or define your models and the
			database schema is generated and/or deployed to the database from
			the models themselves. Some frameworks like Ruby and Catalyst
			go one step further and allow that schema to be versioned,
			allowing easier upgrades/downgrades of the schema itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since the second method is more exciting and offers more insight
			into how the various frameworks work, that will be what I do when
			the framework supports it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Today we'll explore how to create database and model in the
			various frameworks and explore the difference between them. You
			can jump to any specific framework using the links below.
		</p>

		</ul>

		
		<h2><a name="aspnetmvc"></a>ASP.NET MVC</h2>
		<p>
			With .NET 3.0 came LINQ, a new way to model database tables to
			strongly typed classes. This new method works much like the
			strongly typed datasets of old from the user perspective. Pick a
			table, map it to properties, map stored procedures for actions,
			then code away with strongly types classes representing your
			table data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, ASP.NET MVC is a database-first framework. You must
			create the database and tables first. You can't create the LINQ to
			SQL classes first and then create the database/tables from the
			LINQ classes. Maybe this will change with IronRuby.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the Database</h3>
		<p>
			First, to create the database, Right-click the project file and
			choose "Add New Item". Select "SQL Server Database". Name the new
			database "BurningPlate.mdf" and click "Add".
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet1.png">
				<img src='aspnet1.png' width="204" height="152" alt="rails run" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Studio gripes about the file type and asks us if we want to put it
			it in our App_Data folder. Say "Yes" and it will. :-)
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet2.png">
				<img src='aspnet2.png' width="204" height="152" alt="rails run" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet3.png">
				<img src='aspnet3.png' width="204" height="152" alt="rails run" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we have a database, we need to create a new table.
			Double-click the new database and a Server Explorer will open on
			the left.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet4.png">
				<img src='aspnet4.png' width="204" height="152" alt="rails run" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Right-click on he Tables folder and choose "Add New Table" 
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet5.png">
				<img src='aspnet5.png' width="204" height="152" alt="rails run" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			As we'll see in other frameworks, LINQ to SQL classes have some
			singular/pluralization ('inflection') naming magic to them. In our
			case, a restaurants table is a collection of rows, where each row
			is a restaurant. For now, lets name our table "Restaurants".
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet6.png">
				<img src='aspnet6.png' width="204" height="152" alt="rails run" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we have a new table, we'll add our id and name columns.
			We'll follow the frameworks naming conventions and add an Id field,
			setting the type to INT. We also need to set the column property
			"Is Identity" below to make it an auto-increment field. Add the
			Name column, setting the type to VARCHAR and change the length to
			100 and click the Save button.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet9.png">
				<img src='aspnet9.png' width="204" height="152" alt="rails run" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the Model</h3>
		<p>
			Now that we have our database and table, we need to create the
			model class to access that data. To create our new model,
			Right-click the projects Models folder and select "Add New Item".
			Choose "LINQ to SQL Classes" and name it "BurningPlate.dbml".
		</p>

		<p>
			That's it. We have a new database, table and model for use in
			ASP.NET MVC applications. Notice how the model was given the name
			"Restaurant". That's inflection. You can of course name your
			model anything you want, and you can alter the name of the table
			it points to at any time.

		<h2><a name="cakephp"></a>CakePHP</h2>
		<p>
			Like most other frameworks and unlike the ASP.NET MVC framework,
			CakePHP can create database tables from a schema definition
			using it's own generic descriptive methods/properties to describe
			tables. Before we do that, we need to continue the database
			configuration that we skipped when we
			<a href="/blog/mvc-marathon-part-1-creating-a-new-application/#cakephp">created</a>
			or new CakePHP application.
		</p>
		<p>
			To finish configuring our database information, just rerun
			<kbd>cake bake</kbd> within our app directory.

Wrote /Users/claco/mvc-marathon/cakephp/Burningplate/config/database.php</pre>

			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> We've given the database path as a
				relative path. The <kbd>cake</kbd> command line utils consider
				the root path of my app as the BurningPlate folder, but
				CakePHP under Apache thinks the root path is
				<kbd>BurningRiver/webroot</kbd>. This means when using a
				relative database path, one or the other won't find the
				database. Not very portable by default. In order to fix that,
				I had to add the following to the database config:
			</p>
			<pre>class DATABASE_CONFIG {
function __construct() {
	$this-&gt;default[&#x27;database&#x27;] = APP . $this-&gt;default[&#x27;database&#x27;];
}</pre>

			<h3>Creating the Database</h3>
			<p>
				Now that we've told CakePHP where and what database we're
				going to use, we need to create our restaurants table. Since
				we're trying to always create the tables from the models, we'll
				do that first.
			</p>
			<p>
				CakePHP uses inflection to automagically wire up default code
				and save the user as much time as possible <em>if</em> you
				follow certain naming conventions. To create tables from
				definitions, you need to create definitions in the
				<kbd>config/sql/schema.php</kbd> file. Of course, you can also
				point a model at any old table and it will work. Schemas aren't
				mandatory.
			</p>
			<p>
				As above, we want a table that has an id integer as the primary
				key and a name varchar field, both not null. Unlike ASP.NET
				where we have to tell the database that the pk field was auto
				and let it manage the pk auto increment, CakePHP assumes that
				any integer primary key field is an auto increment field and
				will manage the ids automatically. It will work as expected
				even if you happen to have an existing table where the pk is
				defined as auto increment. You can even use UUIDs for the
				primary key just by making that field a CHAR(36) instead. But
				I digress...
			</p>
			<pre>class BurningPlateSchema extends CakeSchema {
	public $restaurants = array(
        &#x27;id&#x27; =&gt; array(&#x27;type&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;integer&#x27;, &#x27;null&#x27; =&gt; false, &#x27;default&#x27; =&gt; NULL, &#x27;key&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;primary&#x27;),
        &#x27;name&#x27; =&gt; array(&#x27;type&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;string&#x27;, &#x27;null&#x27; =&gt; false, &#x27;length&#x27; =&gt; 100),
        &#x27;indexes&#x27; =&gt; array(&#x27;PRIMARY&#x27; =&gt; array(&#x27;column&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;id&#x27;, &#x27;unique&#x27; =&gt; 1))

				Now that we have a schema defined, we need to create the table
				from the schema definition. Let's see what the command help
				has to offer:

			<p>
				CakePHP simply inspected the database, asked us which table to
				create a model for and created the necessary files, including
				tests.
			</p>
			<p>
				Again, take note of the inflection here. We created a table
				called restaurants but the model created was Restaurant. If
				you were to manually created a model called Post, it would
				by default look for a table called posts. This can, of course,
				be overridden using the <samp>$useTable</samp> variable.
			</p>
			<p>
				While there is a <kbd>cake console</kbd> that we could use to
				test out model and create a record, I couldn't get it to work.
				It could connect to the database and find records, but it
				would not save a new record, even though it said
				"Saved record for Restaurant".
			</p>



		<h2><a name="catalyst"></a>Catalyst</h2>
		<p>
			One of the Perl mantras is TIMTOWTDI: There is more than one way
			to do it. As such, Catalyst doesn't come with database support
			out of the box. One reason for this is that there are more than
			one ORM packages for Perl and different reasons for an author to
			prefer one over the other. However, if you install the bundle
			referenced in the official tutorial, it will install of the
			necessary bits to do database work.
		</p>
		<p>
			Much like CakePHP, you can have three distinct layers when using
			a database in Catalyst: The models generated from the schema, the
			schema describing the database and the database itself. You can
			choose to statically or dynamical create the schema from the
			database or do the reverse: create the database from the schema.
		</p>
		<p>
			For this application, I'm going to use the new schema versioning
			built into <kbd>DBIx::Class</kbd>. Like CakePHP above, we're
			going to create our schema first, deploy it to the database and
			then create models from our schema.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Creating the Database</h3>
		<p>
			Unlike CakePHP, we need to get down and dirty with writing some
			code manually to get our schema started and to maintain the
			schema versions and upgrades. This isn't as bad as it sounds.
			Most of the heavy lifting is already coded for us. First, we need
			to create out schema file in <kbd>lib/BurningPlate/Scheme.pm</kbd>
		</p>
		<pre>package BurningPlate::Schema;
use strict;
use warnings;
use base &#x27;DBIx::Class::Schema&#x27;;
our $VERSION = 0;

__PACKAGE__-&gt;load_classes;
__PACKAGE__-&gt;load_components(&#x27;+DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned&#x27;);
__PACKAGE__-&gt;upgrade_directory(&#x27;sql/&#x27;);
__PACKAGE__-&gt;backup_directory(&#x27;sql/backups/&#x27;);

1;</pre>

		<p>
			In a nutshell, we're telling DBIx::Class to load all
			BurningPlate::Schema::* child classes, load the versioning module,
			and place the schema upgrade/backup files in the given directories.
			Take note of the <kbd>$VERSION</kbd> variable. This is used by
			the versioning module to determine what version the schema is
			compared to the database versioning information table.
		</p>
		<p>
			We could create our table schema and deploy the schema to the
			database. DBIx::Class currently considers any database without
			a versioning table to be the current version and will not upgrade
			anything even if it difference from your schema classes. Because
			of this, it's better to consider version 1 a blank database and
			work up from there. We're going to deploy what we have now before
			we add the restaurants table.
		</p>
		<p>
			DBIx::Class doesn't come with console scripts to generate schema
			versioning files or upgrade database. But because they're simple
			method calls, they're easy enough to create. First our schema sql
			script <kbd>script/burningplate_schema.pl</kbd>
		</p>
		<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use warnings;
use FindBin;
use lib &quot;$FindBin::Bin/../lib&quot;;
use BurningPlate::Schema;

my $version = BurningPlate::Schema-&gt;schema_version;

BurningPlate::Schema-&gt;connect-&gt;create_ddl_dir(
    [&#x27;SQLite&#x27;],
    $version &gt; 1 ? $version : undef,
    &#x27;sql&#x27;,
    $version ? $version-1 : $version
);</pre>
		<p>
			The script basically loads the schema, finds the version, then
			calls <kbd>create_ddl_dir</kbd> to create sql ddl files from the
			current schema version. If the version is greater than 1, we also
			create an sql file that contains the difference between the
			versions. This is the heart of schema versioning. Database changes
			can be rolled out incrementally from one version to the next. We
			specified SQLite, but you can create multiple schemas at the same
			time for multiple database vendors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, we'll run the script to generate our version 1 ddl files.
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate $ script/*schema.pl
Your DB is currently unversioned. Please call upgrade on your schema to sync the DB.</pre>
		<p>
			Now, in our sql directory, we have a new file:
		</p>
		<pre>--

-- 
BEGIN TRANSACTION;


COMMIT;
</pre>
		<p>
			Since we have no tables yet, we have no sql to deploy but we must
			still run an upgrade to install the versioning table and the
			current version number. Since we have no console script to do that
			,  we'll create one in <kbd>script/burningplate_upgrade.pl</kbd>
		</p>
		<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use warnings;
use FindBin;
use lib &quot;$FindBin::Bin/../lib&quot;;
use BurningPlate::Schema;

BurningPlate::Schema-&gt;connect(@ARGV)-&gt;upgrade;</pre>
		<p>
			In this script, we simply connect to the specified database and
			upgrade it to the latest version. Now we can deploy our first
			version and the versioning tables.
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate $ script/*upgrade.pl dbi:SQLite:burning_plate.db
Your DB is currently unversioned. Please call upgrade on your schema to sync the DB.</pre>

		<p>
			Now, let's define our restaurants schema and deploy it to the
			database. First, we need to increase the schema $VERSION to 2.
			Next, we'll create <kbd>BurningPlate/Schema/Restaurant.pm</kbd>
		</p>
		<pre>package BurningPlate::Schema::Restaurant;
use strict;
use warnings;
use base &#x27;DBIx::Class&#x27;;
__PACKAGE__-&gt;load_components(&#x27;Core&#x27;);
__PACKAGE__-&gt;table(&#x27;restaurants&#x27;);
__PACKAGE__-&gt;add_columns(
    id =&gt; {
        data_type =&gt; &#x27;INT&#x27;,
        is_nullable =&gt; 0,
        is_auto_increment =&gt; 1
    },
    name =&gt; {
        data_type =&gt; &#x27;VARCHAR&#x27;,
        size =&gt; 100,
        is_nullable =&gt; 0
    }
);
__PACKAGE__-&gt;set_primary_key(&#x27;id&#x27;);

1;</pre>
			<p>
				Much like the CakePHP schema, we are telling the schema the
				names and properties of the columns and a primary key. Now
				that we have a complete schema, we need to deploy it to a
				database. First, we'll generate the version 2 sql.
			</p>
			<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate $ script/*schema.pl</pre>
			<p>
				Now, if you look in the sql folder, we have two new files.
				First, we have <kbd>BurningPlate-Schema-2-SQLite.sql</kbd>.
				This contains the entire schema as it exists in version 2 if
				we were to deploy the entire schema from scratch.
			</p>
			<pre>-- 
-- Created by SQL::Translator::Producer::SQLite
-- Created on Tue Jul  8 22:52:12 2008

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Table: restaurants
--
DROP TABLE restaurants;
CREATE TABLE restaurants (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

COMMIT;
</pre>
		<p>
			We also have a second file: <kbd>BurningPlate-Schema-1-2-SQLite.sql</kbd>.
			This file contains all the sql necessary to upgrade a database from
			version to version 2.
		</p>
		<pre>-- Convert schema &#x27;sql/BurningPlate-Schema-1-SQLite.sql&#x27; to &#x27;sql/BurningPlate-Schema-2-SQLite.sql&#x27;:

BEGIN;

CREATE TABLE restaurants (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

COMMIT;
</pre>
		<p>
			Later on if we were to add a column to version 3, the 2->3 file
			would contain an ALTER TABLE statement. Now, we just need to deploy
			the new version to the database using the same command we ran before:
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate $ script/*upgrade.pl dbi:SQLite:burning_plate.db
Versions out of sync. This is 2, your database contains version 1, please call upgrade on your Schema.</pre>
		<p>
			The warnings are a little misleading. They're generated by the call
			to connect() which do before calling upgrade.
		</p>

		<h3>Creating the Model</h3>
		<p>
			Now that we have our schema and database, we need to create a model
			to access that data. There are many ways to do this in Catalyst.
			One can manually create a model and load the schema directly or
			you can bypass the schema class and write database access code
			to use the database directly. Let's see what the create script
			has to say:
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate $ script/burningplate_create.pl
Usage:
    burningplate_create.pl [options] model|view|controller name [helper]
    [options]

     Options:
       -force        don&#x27;t create a .new file where a file to be created exists
       -mechanize    use Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst for tests if available
       -help         display this help and exits

     Examples:
       burningplate_create.pl controller My::Controller
       burningplate_create.pl controller My::Controller BindLex
       burningplate_create.pl -mechanize controller My::Controller
       burningplate_create.pl view My::View
       burningplate_create.pl view MyView TT
       burningplate_create.pl view TT TT
       burningplate_create.pl model My::Model
       burningplate_create.pl model SomeDB DBIC::Schema MyApp::Schema create=dynamic\
       dbi:SQLite:/tmp/my.db
       burningplate_create.pl model AnotherDB DBIC::Schema MyApp::Schema create=static\
       dbi:Pg:dbname=foo root 4321

     See also:
       perldoc Catalyst::Manual
       perldoc Catalyst::Manual::Intro
</pre>
		<p>
			The easiest way to use our schema  as a model without writing code
			is to use <kbd>Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema</kbd> listed above.
			This will automatically load a schema class and create a model for
			each table (resultsource in DBIC speak) found. To create our
			model, we simply call the create script, passing in the
			appropriate options:
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate $ script/burningplate_create.pl model DB DBIC::Schema BurningPlate::Schema dbi:SQLite:burning_plate.db
 exists &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../lib/BurningPlate/Model&quot;
 exists &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../t&quot;
created &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../lib/BurningPlate/Model/DB.pm&quot;
created &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../t/model_DB.t&quot;</pre>
		<p>
			Just like CakePHP, it generated a model file and created a test
			file for us. If we reload the application, we now see that the
			new model is loaded and ready for action.

		there is a utility called <kbd>dbicadmin</kbd> that can be used to
		perform CRUD operations with the schema. On the down side, the schema
		doesn't hold the database connection information; the model does. So
		using the utility isn't practical in this case without altering code.
	</p>
	

		<h2><a name="django"></a>Django</h2>
		<p>
			Django takes a more compact approach than CakePHP and Catalyst w/
			DBIx::Class. In Django, there is no separation between models and
			the schema. In fact, all of the models are defined in one single
			models.py class instead of putting separate classes in a models
			directory like Catalyst/CakePHP do.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the Model</h3>
		<p>
			Creating models in Django is just a matter of creating the
			models.py file. You also get a modesl.py file for free when you
			run <kbd>manage.py startapp</kbd>, which creates a new application
			sudirectory in the project we previously created. Since we're not
			really creating multiple apps right now, we'll just create the
			models.py file in the project root.
		</p>
		<pre>from django.db import models

class Restaurant(models.Model):
    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
</pre>
		<p>
			In the file above, we created a new Restaurant class and defined
			the id and name fields. AutoField implies a code managed
			(not db managed) auto increment int field, and we've set primary
			key and the name length.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Creating the Database</h3>
		<p>
			Now that we have a model, we need to create a database from it.
			First, we need to tell Django how to conect to the new database
			by changing <kbd>settinga.py</kbd>
		</p>
		<pre>DATABASE_ENGINE = &#x27;sqlite3&#x27;           # &#x27;postgresql_psycopg2&#x27;, &#x27;postgresql&#x27;, &#x27;mysql&#x27;, &#x27;sqlite3&#x27; or &#x27;ado_mssql&#x27;.
DATABASE_NAME = &#x27;burning_plate.db&#x27;    # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.</pre>
		
		<p>
			While we're in here, we need to tell this Django project that it
			also should load our new BurningPlate application, which is now
			only a models.py file. If we wanted to use other apps in our project,
			we could just laod them here.
		</p>
		<pre>INSTALLED_APPS = (
    &#x27;django.contrib.auth&#x27;,
    &#x27;django.contrib.contenttypes&#x27;,
    &#x27;django.contrib.sessions&#x27;,
    &#x27;django.contrib.sites&#x27;,
    &#x27;BurningPlate&#x27;
)</pre>

		<p>
			Now, to create our database, we just run the syncd command.
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/django/BurningPlate $ python manage.py syncdb
Creating table auth_permission
Creating table auth_group
Creating table auth_user
Creating table auth_message
Creating table django_content_type
Creating table django_session
Creating table django_site

You just installed Django&#x27;s auth system, which means you don&#x27;t have any superusers defined.
Would you like to create one now? (yes/no): no
Installing index for auth.Permission model
Creating table BurningPlate_restaurant</pre>

		<p>
			That's all there is to it. Django created a bunch of auth related
			tables and then our restaurant table. Let's take a gander at the 
			schema:
		</p>
		<pre>CREATE TABLE &quot;BurningPlate_restaurant&quot; (
    &quot;id&quot; integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    &quot;name&quot; varchar(100) NOT NULL
);</pre>
		<p>
			Django also doesn't play any inflection games. The model name
			is the table name. However, since Django projects are assumed to
			have multiple apps within them, the name of the app has been
			prepended to the table name to avoid name collisions. You can
			override the table name using the <kbd>db_table</kbd> variable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, let's fire up the interactive console and test out our model.
		</p>
	<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/django/BurningPlate $ python manage.py shell

		<h2><a name="rails"></a>Ruby on Rails</h2>
		<p>
			Rails has migrations which is a lot like the Catalyst/DBIx::Class
			schema versioning with a little more glue around the edges to make
			thing go quicker. Like CakePHP and Catalyst, the model, schema (or
			migrations) and the database are three separate layers. Unlike
			Django models, Rails (ActiveRecord based) models don't describe
			the schema. Instead, they operate by dynamically inspecting the
			table they're working on.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the Model</h3>
		<p>
			Like Catalyst and CakePHP, we can use the console scripts to create
			a new model and do all sorts of other things. First, let's see what
			generate tells us.
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/rails/BurningPlate $ script/generate
Usage: script/generate generator [options] [args]

Rails Info:
    -v, --version                    Show the Rails version number and quit.
    -h, --help                       Show this help message and quit.

General Options:
    -p, --pretend                    Run but do not make any changes.
    -f, --force                      Overwrite files that already exist.
    -s, --skip                       Skip files that already exist.
    -q, --quiet                      Suppress normal output.
    -t, --backtrace                  Debugging: show backtrace on errors.
    -c, --svn                        Modify files with subversion. (Note: svn must be in path)

			Now, let's check out the model option.
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/rails/BurningPlate $ script/generate model

General Options:
    -p, --pretend                    Run but do not make any changes.
    -f, --force                      Overwrite files that already exist.
    -s, --skip                       Skip files that already exist.

    -t, --backtrace                  Debugging: show backtrace on errors.
    -c, --svn                        Modify files with subversion. (Note: svn must be in path)

Description:
    Stubs out a new model. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model&#x27;s attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don&#x27;t have to
    specify them by hand as &#x27;created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime&#x27;.

    You don&#x27;t have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the model immediately.

    This generates a model class in app/models, a unit test in test/unit,
    a test fixture in test/fixtures/singular_name.yml, and a migration in
    db/migrate.

Examples:
    `./script/generate model account`

        creates an Account model, test, fixture, and migration:
            Model:      app/models/account.rb
            Test:       test/unit/account_test.rb
            Fixtures:   test/fixtures/accounts.yml
            Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_accounts.rb

    `./script/generate model post title:string body:text published:boolean`

        creates a Post model with a string title, text body, and published flag.
</pre>
		<p>
			We could pass in our column definitions in one shot, but where's the
			fun in that? Let's create a new model.
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/rails/BurningPlate $ script/generate model Restaurant
      exists  app/models/
      exists  test/unit/
      exists  test/fixtures/
      create  app/models/restaurant.rb
      create  test/unit/restaurant_test.rb
      create  test/fixtures/restaurants.yml
      create  db/migrate
      create  db/migrate/001_create_restaurants.rb</pre>
		<p>
			Just like CakePHP and Catalyst, the script was kind enough to create
			some test files for the new model. It also generated a migration
			file for us. Let's have a look:
		</p>
		<pre>class CreateRestaurants &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :restaurants do |t|
      t.column :name, :string, :limit=&gt;100, :null=&gt;false
      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :restaurants
  end
end
</pre>
		<p>
			Unlike DBIx::Class schema version files which are sql based, 
			Rails migrations are based on code. Up describes what to do when
			migrating from an older version to the current version. Down
			describes what to do when migrating form the current version to the
			previous version. For version 1 [from 0].
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the Database</h3>
		<p>
			Now that we have our model, let's create our database from it.
			We need to use rake, Rubys make, to migrate the database.
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/rails/BurningPlate $ rake db:migrate
(in /Users/claco/mvc-marathon/rails/BurningPlate)
== 1 CreateRestaurants: migrating =============================================
-- create_table(:restaurants)
   -&gt; 0.0025s
== 1 CreateRestaurants: migrated (0.0027s) ====================================
</pre>
		<p>
			Notice the table name: restaurants. Our old friend inflection is
			back. We also didn't have to setup our database connection information.
			The default database.yml config already has a development
			database setup in <kbd>bd/development.sqlite3</kbd>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another item of interest. If we take a look at the table that was
			create, you'll notice something that wasn't in our model:
		</p>
		<pre>CREATE TABLE restaurants (&quot;id&quot; INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
&quot;name&quot; varchar(100) NOT NULL,
&quot;created_at&quot; datetime DEFAULT NULL,
&quot;updated_at&quot; datetime DEFAULT NULL);</pre>

		<p>
			When Rails creates a table from a model, it always adds the id,
			create_at and updated_at fields for automatically set create and
			updated dates when each record is created/modified. CakePHP will
			also maintain create/updated fields but it will not declare them
			for you when you create the tables.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like most of the other frameworks, you can use an interactive
			console to try out your new models.
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/rails/BurningPlate $ script/console
Loading development environment (Rails 2.0.2)
&gt;&gt; Restaurant.create(:name =&gt; &#x27;Azteca&#x27;)
=&gt; #&lt;Restaurant id: 1, name: &quot;Azteca&quot;, created_at: &quot;2008-07-08 22:29:32&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2008-07-08 22:29:32&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; r = Restaurant.find_by_id(1)
=&gt; #&lt;Restaurant id: 1, name: &quot;Azteca&quot;, created_at: &quot;2008-07-08 22:29:32&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2008-07-08 22:29:32&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; r.name
=&gt; &quot;Azteca&quot;
&gt;&gt; quit()
</pre>
		
		<h2><a name="conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Catalyst is my alma mater. Perl is my favorite language, and
					I appreciate that there are many ways to do the same thing
					and nothing is forced upon me. However, as DBIx::Class
					is pushed in the tutorials, it is really the defacto ORM
					for Catalyst. As such, there really needs to be some glue to
					round off the sharp edges.
				</p>
				<p>
					If DBIC is installed or there is a command line option to request it,
					<kbd>catalyst</kbd> should generate a Schema class,
					directories for the sql versioning and a helper script or
					two to help generate schema versioning files and update/deploy
					them. This would go a long way to improving the new user
					experience.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The CakePHP interactive console seems to be a bit immature.
					It doesn't appear to add items, or at least my install
					wasn't very happy. The other thing I'm not sure I can
					accept is that models return data, not objects.
				</p>
				<p>
					The schema management only deploys new tables. It doesn't
					deploy changes. It would be nice to see some sort of
					versioning or migrations like Catalyst/Rails.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fact that the console utilities and webroot look in
					two different places for a database path is a drag. It
					makes things less portable, esp if you have to put in a
					full path.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Compared to Rails migrations and DBIC versioning, Django feels week
					like CakePHP when it comes to syncing the model to the
					database.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love that apps have been given consideration as movable
					reusable parts within many projects. This is something
					that is a little more obtuse in other frameworks.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					I dig Rails migrations. While I can also have custom code
					when upgrading schema versions in Catalyst, migrations feel more
					natural to me. I like that upgrades and downgrades feel
					like they get equal attention and you can migrate to
					any version by number.
				</p>
				<p>
					The magic adding of the id column and the created/updated
					columns scares me a little. If I already have a created
					column instead of a created_At column, well, that could
					lead to issues.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Inflections seem unnecessary to me, esp if you don't speak
					Engrish as the primary language. But, to their credit, at
					least Rails and CakePHP give you control over the inflections
					if you need. Good Magic is magic that can be customized.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					ASP.NET/ADO/SQL aren't really build for versioning or for
					deploying a database schema from the models. To me, this
					makes deploying new versions a little more painful if you
					are stuck writing your alter scripts and such.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					One of the things I like about CakePHP is that by default,
					new models and controllers inherit from an app local model
					and controller base class. Rails controllers also do this. This is easy to do in Catalyst,
					but it's not forced upon you by default. Maybe it should be
					since I hear a lot of "use a base class" responses when
					people ask about creating plugins.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ruby has more of a mixin model rather than multiple inheritance.
					Personally, I'd prefer that Rails models also inherited from an
					app local base class, then mixin-ed ActiveRecord on top of that.
				</p>

Hi, nice series! Looking forward to the other parts. Note that Rails adds the created_at and updated_at columns because of the "t.timestamps" line in your migration file. Remove that and they won't get created. It is there by default, but it is easily removed.

		<h2>Part 3: Creating a Restaurants Controller and View</h2>
		<p>
			In our last installment, we created a database, schema and model
			to get at our list of restaurants. In this episode, I'm going to
			create a controller and view that uses that model to list the
			restaurants in our database.  Where available, I will also use
			any existing CRUD/scaffolding to enter some test data.
		</p>

		</ul>

		
		<h2><a name="aspnetmvc"></a>ASP.NET MVC</h2>
		<p>
			While .NET 3.0 and MVC have made a lot of strides with LINQ and
			Entity Framework (ORM), they completely lack any kind of
			scaffolding or helpers for data management. I'm sure someone is
			working on it, and there are 3rd party package available. For now,
			we'll stick to just creating a controller for the restaurants.
		</p>
<p><strong>Update: I dropped the ball on this one. There is the new Dynamic Data scaffolding in .NET 3.5. It appears that you can create an entirely separate Dynamic Data site, or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668188.aspx">try and work it into an existing site</a>. As it stands,  a separate site doesn't count as part of the MVC solution, and the steps to integrate it are woefully long and complicated. I declare that the same as no real new user friendly solution for the context of this series.</strong></p>
		<h3>Creating the Data</h3>
		<p>
			Before we create our controller, we need to add some test data.
			First, Double-Click the BurningPlate.mdf file in the App_Data
			directory to open the Server Explorer pane. Right-Click on the
			Restaurants table and select "Show Table Data".
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet1.png">
				<img src='aspnet1.png' width="204" height="152" alt="create data" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now enter two restaurants into the Name field: "Siamone Thai"
			and "Azteca".
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the Controller</h3>
		<p>
			Now that we have our test data, we're going to create a controller
			to list that data. Right-Click on the Controllers folder and choose
			"Add New Item".
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet2.png">
				<img src='aspnet2.png' width="204" height="152" alt="create controller" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Select "MVC Controller Class", type RestaurantsController.cs for
			the name and click "Add". By convention in .NET MVC, the controller
			class name should always end in Controller. The default routing
			will assume that any controller path named /foo/ will map to the
			controller FooController. This of course can be changed by tweaking
			the routing, but why create more work for yourself?
		</p>
		<p>
			Much like inflection to relate models to tables automatically,
			controller and view naming is typically referred to as "convention
			or configuration". You can follow naming conventions and have things
			"Just Work", or you can usually deviate from the norm and use
			configuration to over come situations where you need t name things
			differently.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Update: The file name in the add item dialog above is wrong. :-)</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet3.png">
				<img src='aspnet3.png' width="204" height="152" alt="new controller" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we have a shiny new controller class that by default spits
			out a NotImplementedException. Let's add some code to get a list
			of restaurants and feed that to a view.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet4.png">
				<img src='aspnet4.png' width="204" height="152" alt="new controller code" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<pre>public ActionResult Index()
{
    BurningPlateDataContext db = new BurningPlateDataContext();
    List&lt;Restaurant&gt; restaurants = db.Restaurants.ToList();

    return View(restaurants);
}</pre>
		<p>
			In the code above, all we've had to do is instantiate an instance
			of the BurningPlateDataContext class that was auto generated when
			we <a href="/blog/mvc-marathon-part-2-creating-a-database-and-model/#aspnetmvc">created our Model</a>.
			Then we asked it for a list of restaurants using ToList. Finally,
			we passed that list of restaurants to the View method.
		</p>
		<p>
			Explore the View method when you have time. It has many options, 
			and there is more than one way to get data into a view. In our case
			we've chosen to pass the restaurants list using the Model parameter.
			You can also pass it in the ViewData itself. I personally think
			that the main model data should be passed in the Model, and ViewData
			is reserved for all of the extra information like page titles,
			meta tag keywords, links, etc.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the View</h3>
		<p>
			Now that we have a controller that assembles the data, we need
			a way to display it. My much like the routes to controller mappings, 
			.NET MVC will look for a view matching the ControllerName/Action
			path. Since our controller is Restaurants and our action is Index,
			we need to create an Index view in the Restaurants folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just like the routing naming conventions, this can also be customized
			to use views with alternate names and in alternate locations using the
			various View method options.
		</p>
		<p>
			To create the view, Right-Click the Views folder and create a
			folder called "Restaurants". Right-Click that new folder and select
			"Add Item".
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet5.png">
				<img src='aspnet5.png' width="204" height="152" alt="new view" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Because .NET MVC supports master pages (wrapper templated layouts)
			by default, select "MVC View Content Page" and name it after our
			default RestaurantController method "Index" and click "Add". You
			will then be prompted to select a master page. Select the "Site" master
			page in the Shared folder and click "OK".
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet6.png">
				<img src='aspnet6.png' width="204" height="152" alt="new view master select" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we have a new view page, we need to tell it about the
			type of model data we're passing it from the controllers View method
			call in the controller. In our case, we're passing a list o restaurants.
			Right-Click on your new Index.aspx page and select "View Code".
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="aspnet7.png">
				<img src='aspnet7.png' width="204" height="152" alt="new view model type" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<pre>public partial class Index : ViewPage&lt;List&lt;Restaurant&gt;&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			To tell the view to expect a list of restaurants, we simply add
			a type definition to the view class definition. In our case, that
			means changing ViewPage to ViewPage&lt;List&lt;Restaurans&gt;&gt;.
			This tells intellisense that when accessing the ViewData.Model
			property that it is a List of Restaurants objects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we have told the page what the model is, we simply
			need to add a loop to the template to display the list of restaurants.
			Double-Click your Index.aspx file to open the page view.

&lt;% foreach (var restaurant in ViewData.Model) { %&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;%= restaurant.Name %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			In our view, we added a loop against the ViewData.Model and printed
			out each restaurants name in an unordered list.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we have a controller and a view, let's check out our
			work by going to /restaurants/.

				<img src='aspnet11.png' width="204" height="152" alt="new view model browser" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			As a final touch, let's add a link to the home page to get to
			our new restaurants index view. To do that, open the Site.Master
			view and between the Home and About Us links, add a call to
			Html.ActionLink to build our link.

		<pre>&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;%= Html.ActionLink(&quot;Restaurants&quot;, &quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Restaurants&quot;)%&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			Hardcoding links suck. MVC takes care of this by using the routing
			tables to create a link using the controller and action names.
			This means that if the controller or action names change, the links
			to then automatically change as well. No need to go rooting through code
			to update links.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's check out our link to make sure it works.

		<h2><a name="cakephp"></a>CakePHP</h2>
		<p>
			Unlike .NET MVC, CakePHP has CRUD scaffolding already built into

What would you like to Bake? (D/M/V/C/P/Q) 
&gt; Q</pre>
		<p>
			Here we've asked to create a new controller. Cake knew what models
			and tables we have and prompts us to choose one. It also asked if
			we want to use scaffolding and create unit tests.
		</p>
		<pre>&lt;?php
class RestaurantsController extends AppController {

	var $name = &#x27;Restaurants&#x27;;
	var $scaffold;
}
?&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			As we see form the controller that was created, the only code
			needed to CRUD data is <samp>var $scaffold;</samp>. Also, just
			like .NET MVC, the class is named RestaurantsController, which
			routing will map to the /restaurants/ path.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the View</h3>
		<p>
			Because we've chosen to use scaffolding, the views and all of the
			necessary code needed to maintait the restaurants table is already
			taken care of. Let's take a look at what it provides:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="cake1.png">
				<img src='cake1.png' width="204" height="152" alt="cake list" />
			</a>
			<a href="cake2.png">
				<img src='cake2.png' width="204" height="152" alt="cake new" />
			</a>
			<a href="cake3.png">
				<img src='cake3.png' width="204" height="152" alt="cake list" />
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			With one variable, we have a full working scaffolding to manage
			our data. Now, let's add a link to the front page going to our
			new restaurants controller.
		</p>
		<p>
			To add our link we need to edit the home.ctp page in the Views
			folder.
		</p>
		<pre>&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;?php echo Router::url(array(&#x27;controller&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;Restaurants&#x27;, &#x27;action&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;index&#x27;));?&gt;&quot;&gt;Restaurants&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			Just like .NET MVC, we're using the routing information to
			generate a link rather than hard coding it, passing in the 
			controller name and the action we're linking to. Now that should
			appear on the default home page.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="cake4.png">
				<img src='cake4.png' width="204" height="152" alt="new view model browser" />
			</a>
		</p>



		<h2><a name="catalyst"></a>Catalyst</h2>
		<p>
			Because Catalyst doesn't force any specific ORM upon you, that
			also means that there is no official CRUD or scaffolding support
			out of the box. Depending on the ORM you choose, there are some
			pretty good options.
		</p>
		<p>
			Class::DBI users have Catalyst::Enzyme.
			Rose::DB users have Rose::DBx::Garden::Catalyst
			(based on CatalystX::CRUD). While there are CatalystX::CRUD Models
			, you still have to write forms views and processing for it.
			There is also Catalyst-Example-InstantCRUD seems to be old and dead.
			There's also CatalystX::ListFramework and CatalystX::ListFramework::Builder
			<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">which requires some wireup work for the former and the latter
			creates an entire application, apparently separate from the public application.</span>
		</p>
		<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">
			Since we're using DBIx::Class, and the current options don't meet
			our needs without a divergence from this series, we'll skip CRUD
			scaffolding for the time being.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the Data</h3>
		<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">
			Since we have no CRUD scaffolding, we need to create the data the
			old fashioned way. You have to choices. First, use the dbicadmin script
			to run insert statements. Second, use the sqlite command line
			utilities to run SQL insert statement. I chose the latter. I won't
			cover that utility usage here.
		</p>

<p>
To add the CRUD scaffolding to our add, we need to load the CatalystX::ListFramework::Builder plugin, point it to our extjs javascript files and tell it to live in the admin url space.
</p>
<p>
To load the plugin, simple add it to the <kdb>use Catalyst</kdb> line in your application file:
</p>
<pre># Start the application
__PACKAGE__-&gt;setup(qw/
    -Debug
    ConfigLoader
    +CatalystX::ListFramework::Builder
    Static::Simple
/);</pre>

<p>Now we need to tell it where our ExtJS files are located. We do this by adding enries to our configuration file for the plugins root controller. This is covered in its documentation. While we're in the config file, we can also tell it to put the CRUD in the admin url namespace:</p>

<pre>extjs2   /static/extjs
&lt;Controller::LFB::Root&gt;
	&lt;action&gt;
		&lt;base&gt;
			PathPart admin
		&lt;/base&gt;
	&lt;/action&gt;
&lt;/Controller::LFB::Root&gt;</pre>

<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Currently, the CRUD requires it's own Model to access the database. I expect this will change in the future. In the mean time, we can just create a model that inherits from the model we've previously created.</p>

<pre style="text-decoration: line-through;">package BurningPlate::Model::LFB::DBIC;

use strict;
use base 'BurningPlate::Model::DB';

1;</pre>

<p>
The latest versions of LFB automatically detect any models that use DBIC::Schema and adds them to the main admin index page.
</p>

<p>Now fire up your application and go to the admin url you specified in config. From there we can use the interface to add data.</p>

			</a>
		</p>


		<h3>Creating the Controller</h3>
		<p>
			To create the controller, we'll just call the scripts/*create.pl
			script, giving it the name of the controller to create.
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate $ script/*create.pl controller Restaurants
 exists &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../lib/BurningPlate/Controller&quot;
 exists &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../t&quot;
created &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../lib/BurningPlate/Controller/Restaurants.pm&quot;
created &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../t/controller_Restaurants.t&quot;</pre>

		<p>
			The script has created a new controller class for us along with
			a unit test file for that controller. Now we need to add code
			to retrieve a list of restaurants and send that to a view.
		</p>
		<pre>$c-&gt;stash-&gt;{&#x27;restaurants&#x27;} = [$c-&gt;model(&#x27;Restaurant&#x27;)-&gt;search-&gt;all];</pre>
		<p>
			In the code above, we ask the Restaurant model to search for all
			restaurant records and assign the results to an array called
			restaurants in the stash. The stash is just like the ViewData in 
			.NET MVC, holding data for the view to access and render.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the View</h3>
		<p>
			Now that we have our restaurants, we need a view to display them.
			Catalyst doesn't assume out of the box that your views will be
			in any specific language, or even that they will use templates at all.
			This means we need to create a view class to render templates and
			an actual template.
		</p>
		<p>
			We'll use the create.pl script again to create a view class.
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate $ script/*create.pl view TT TT
created &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../lib/BurningPlate/View&quot;
 exists &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../t&quot;
created &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../lib/BurningPlate/View/TT.pm&quot;
created &quot;/Users/claco/mvc-marathon/catalyst/BurningPlate/script/../t/view_TT.t&quot;</pre>

		<p>
			Here's we've created a view class using the TT (Template Toolkit)
			helper. By default, Catalyst will use the first view it finds as the
			default view renderer. If you have multiple views, you can call
			the view explicitly or set the default_view or current_view
			config options.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we need to create a template for our controller. Just like
			.NET MVC above, the TT view will look for a template file matching
			the controllers name and action. In our case, the file would be
			named index.tt in a restaurants folder in the root directory.
			You can override the name of the template using the template
			stash variable.
		</p>
		<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
[% FOREACH restaurant IN restaurants %]
	&lt;li&gt;[% restaurant.name %]&lt;/li&gt;
[% END %]
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			Just like the index template for .NET MVC, we simply use the template
			language of choice to create an unordered list, loop through each
			restaurant and print out the name.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we have our view, let's check out our restaurants list
			by going to /restaurants/. Just like Cake and .NET, the path is
			derived form the name of the class. Unlike Cake and .NET, there
			is no central routing configuration to tweak if you need to
			change the urls. Instead, you can simply change the path
			configuration variable in each controller. You can however change
			that config parameter within the main configuration file too, 
			so I guess there technically is a central routing table. :-)

		<h2><a name="django"></a>Django</h2>
		<p>
			Because Django was born our of the publishing industry, it has
			very strong CRUD/scaffolding support out of the box. One needs
			only to load the "admin" modules in their configuration, tell
			it what models to administer, set the admin url and create
			the necessary tables and user using manage.py.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the Data</h3>
		<p>
			In our settings.py, we add a line to load the django.contrib.admin
			module:
		</p>
		<pre>INSTALLED_APPS = (
    &#x27;django.contrib.auth&#x27;,
    &#x27;django.contrib.contenttypes&#x27;,
    &#x27;django.contrib.sessions&#x27;,
    &#x27;django.contrib.sites&#x27;,
    &#x27;django.contrib.admin&#x27;,
    &#x27;BurningPlate&#x27;
)</pre>

	<p>
		Now we need to tell the admin code which models to administer. We can
		do this anywhere, but I'll put it in our model for now.
	</p>
	<pre>admin.site.register(Restaurant)</pre>
	
	<p>
		Now we need to tell Django what url to use for admin access. To do this,
		all we have to do is uncomment some like already in the urls.py file:
	</p>
	<pre>from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

# Uncomment the next two lines to enable the admin:
from django.contrib import admin
admin.autodiscover()

urlpatterns = patterns(&#x27;&#x27;,
    # Example:
    # (r&#x27;^BurningPlate/&#x27;, include(&#x27;BurningPlate.foo.urls&#x27;)),

    # Uncomment the next line to enable admin documentation:
    # (r&#x27;^admin/doc/&#x27;, include(&#x27;django.contrib.admindocs.urls&#x27;)),

    # Uncomment the next line for to enable the admin:
    (r&#x27;^admin/(.*)&#x27;, admin.site.root),
)</pre>

	<p>
		Now that we loaded the admin code and told it which models to administer,
		we need to update the database to include the necessary admin related
		tables. To do this, simply run syncdb.
	</p>
	<pre>claco@mbp ~/BurningPlate $ python manage.py syncdb
Creating table auth_permission
Creating table auth_group
Creating table auth_user
Creating table auth_message
Creating table django_content_type
Creating table django_session
Creating table django_site
Creating table django_admin_log
Creating table BurningPlate_restaurant

You just installed Django&#x27;s auth system, which means you don&#x27;t have any superusers defined.
Would you like to create one now? (yes/no): yes
Username (Leave blank to use &#x27;claco&#x27;): admin
E-mail address: claco@chrislaco.com
Password: 
Password (again): 
Superuser created successfully.
Installing index for auth.Permission model
Installing index for auth.Message model
Installing index for admin.LogEntry model</pre>
		<p>
			Django created the needed tables for us and also prompted us to create
			a username/password for access. Now let's check out the admin web
			interface. and add our data.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="django1.png">
				<img src='django1.png' width="204" height="152" alt="django list" />
			</a>
			<a href="django2.png">

			</a>
			<a href="django4.png">
				<img src='django4.png' width="204" height="152" alt="django list" />
			</a>
		</p>

		<h3>Creating the Controller</h3>
		<p>
			While Django is an "MVC" like framework, it considers the Controller
			to be the "view", and the View as the "template". Aside from this
			naming juggle, it's still the same in practice: a separation of
			getting the data and displaying the data.
		</p>
		<p>
			To create our controller, simply create a restaurants directory
			and define the views for it.
		</p>
		<pre>from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
from BurningPlate.models import Restaurant

def index(request):
    restaurants = Restaurant.objects.all()
    return render_to_response(&#x27;restaurants/index.html&#x27;, {&#x27;restaurants&#x27;: restaurants})
</pre>
		<p>
			In the code above, we loaded request handling modules, loaded our
			Restaurants model and defined an index action that loads all restaurants
			and renders the index.html template, passing it the restaurants list in much
			the same we use the stash in Catalyst of the ViewData in .NET.
			Like Catalyst, the template can be named anything you want it to be.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unlike the other frameworks, url mapping is a manual process. To
			expose the restaurants controller, we need to add it to our urls.py
			file:
		</p>
		<pre>(r&#x27;^restaurants/$&#x27;, &#x27;BurningPlate.restaurants.views.index&#x27;)</pre>
	
		<h3>Creating the View</h3>
		<p>
			By default, Django looks for
			its templates in a path outside of the application root.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the sake of keeping it all in the same directory in the
			repository, I've tweaked the config to point to the current
			directory as the root template directory.
		</p>
		<pre>TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    # Put strings here, like &quot;/home/html/django_templates&quot; or &quot;C:/www/django/templates&quot;.
    # Always use forward slashes, even on Windows.
    # Don&#x27;t forget to use absolute paths, not relative paths.
    &quot;.&quot;
)</pre>
		<p>
			Now in our restaurants directory, we create an index.html with
			the code to print out the restaurants.
		</p>
		<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
{% for restaurant in restaurants %}
    &lt;li&gt;{{ restaurant.name }}&lt;/li&gt;
{% endfor %}
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			Looks familiar doesn't it? Let's check it out in our browser.

		<h2><a name="rails"></a>Ruby on Rails</h2>
		<p>
			Unfortunately for me, I upgraded to Leopard, which means I also got
			the latest Rails 2.1. The scaffolding in 2.1 has changed from
			previous versions. It also apparently can't be added to an existing
			model as it insists on creating it's own model as part of the process.
			This means we have to ditch the model we built in the last
			article.
		</p>
		<h3>Creating the Controller/View/Data</h3>
		<p>
			To create the controller and scaffolding, simply run the generate
			scaffold command, passing it the name of the model and the fields
			to create:
		</p>
		<pre>claco@mbp ~/mvc-marathon/rails/BurningPlate $ script/generate scaffold restaurant name:string
    exists  app/models/
    exists  app/controllers/
    exists  app/helpers/
    create  app/views/restaurants
    create  app/views/layouts/
    exists  test/functional/

    create  app/views/restaurants/new.html.erb
    create  app/views/restaurants/edit.html.erb
    create  app/views/layouts/restaurants.html.erb
    create  public/stylesheets/scaffold.css
    create  app/controllers/restaurants_controller.rb
    create  test/functional/restaurants_controller_test.rb
    create  app/helpers/restaurants_helper.rb
     route  map.resources :restaurants
dependency  model
    exists    app/models/
    exists    test/unit/
    exists    test/fixtures/
    create    app/models/restaurant.rb
    create    test/unit/restaurant_test.rb
    create    test/fixtures/restaurants.yml
    exists    db/migrate
    create    db/migrate/20080731023309_create_restaurants.rb</pre>

		<p>
			As you can see, this created everything we need to get started.
			The mode, the migration, the views, the controller and the
			tests/test fixtures. Normally you would run rake db:migrate to
			setup the database. But because we've already done the same in our
			previous article, we don't need to do that here.

		<h2><a name="conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					It would be nice if ASP.NET MVC, Catalyst and Django created
					controllers that pushed the idea of using an app level
					base class like Cake and Rails do. I hear "use a base class"
					all the time in Catalyst discussions  in response to people
					wanting to create plugins. It  would be better for the new
					user to be led to practice what is preached.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					While Rails scaffolding is nice and can be customized, 
					it can't be added to and existing controller/model. This means
					you need to know that you have to use it first. It would be
					much more useful if you could at least point it to an existing
					model.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					CakePHP scaffolding is quite nice but it's not very easy
					to customize like the Django admin section is. It is pretty
					easy to move into an admin set of controllers namespace though.
				</p>
<p>Ruby strikes a nice balance here as well. It generates CRUD scaffold for you, but in the end it's just code on your app you can tweak any way you want.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Django admin scaffolding is the bomb. It's in it's own
					directory with authentication already rolled in.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					CRUD scaffolding in Catalyst is mostly non existent
					for the DBIx::Class user (the ORM pushed in the tutorials)
					unless you're willing to write some glue classes. If you're running
					Rose::DB as your ORM, you're golden. The ListFramework is promising and so is the CatalystX::CRUD stuff. I imagine that given some time, it will have strong CRUD like Django does.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>

BODY:
Yes, there a few of these out there. Some free. Some not free. Some with IDataReader. Some without IDataReader. Some support IsDbNull. Some insist on always using Empty. Some are NotInheritable. Some are.

I wanted a mix of those features and I also wanted to define the columns manually at times using the existing DataColumn bits from the Data namespace.

Thus, the gazillionth <a href="http://github.com/claco/csvdatareader/wikis">CsvDataReader</a> was born. Use it. Steal it. Send patches.
